It is thought that cheese making was first brought to the Yorkshire dales in the 11th century by Cistercian monks who arrived from Normandy and settled in the local abbeys. They in turn passed on the cheese making techniques to the local farmers of Swaledale and thus, Swaledale cheese was born. The Reed family has been making Swaledale cheese in Richmond since 1987.",M3
