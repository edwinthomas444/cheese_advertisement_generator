"Provenance
It is thought that cheese making was first brought to the Yorkshire dales in the 11th century by Cistercian monks who arrived from Normandy and settled in the local abbeys. They in turn passed on the cheese making techniques to the local farmers of Swaledale and thus, Swaledale cheese was born. The Reed family has been making Swaledale cheese in Richmond since 1987.",M3
The Swaledale recipe and methods are protected and accredited with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. This is recognised world wide and safe guards the future production and quality of one of the dales most cherished treasures.,M2
"Best age & season
Lambing is the start of our production season for Swaledale ewes cheese PDO. The season is short and is dictated by the Ewes. We produce from April through to October and the cheese is best eaten between 4 and 6 weeks.",M5
"Serving suggestions
Cheese and wine are a match made in heaven and which wine you enjoy with which cheese relies a lot on personal preference. Our suggestion for this one is a dry Champagne.",M5
"The cheese is also a fantastic cooking cheese and makes scrumptious Ewes cheese and spinach soufflé.
