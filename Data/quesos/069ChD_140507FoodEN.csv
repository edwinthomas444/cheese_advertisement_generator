"However, when the EU Protected Food Name scheme was introduced in the 1990s the dairy was forced to drop the use of the name Parmesan and instead renamed their Italian style hard cheese %u201CFarmers Hand%u201D.",M2
They then started to experiment with a cheese that was a cross between Cheddar and Parmesan and named it Sussex Charmer. This is a hard-pressed cheese,M2
matured for up to 1 year,M3
with the flavour profile matching perfectly the hybrid claim.,M2
The company has subsequently moved to a different location and is now called Bookham Harrison Foods.,M1
