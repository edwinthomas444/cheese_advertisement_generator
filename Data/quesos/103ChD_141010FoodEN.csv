"Describing cheeses is difficult! In my struggle to do that, I may be guilty of over-using the term 'distinctive ... but when it comes to Sue Proudfoot's cheeses, that adjective definitely fits the bill!  Sue's Keltic Gold has gained her a lot of attention, as a classy 'washed rind' cheese (local cider is used).",M2
"Miss Muffet and Keltic Gold are close relations, but use different starter cultures and MM doesn't have the washed rind.",M2
 The result is a sweet flavoured cheese,M2
"with a supple texture, definitely 'semi-soft' and somehow not what you think of as English cheese! ",M2
"Michael Raffael talks about ""a springiness and cleanness on the palate, like the best Dutch Edams and Goudas"".",M2
