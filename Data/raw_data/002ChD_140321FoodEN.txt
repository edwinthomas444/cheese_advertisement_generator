Bonchester

Bonchester is a British cheese awarded with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). The cheese was first developed on the Easter Weens Farm in 1980, on the border lands of England and Scotland, in Bonchester Bridge. Bonchester Bridge is in Roxburghshire, Scotland. However, the cheese is currently not in production.

Shaped in small, round flat cylinders and coated with a white rind, Bonchester is made from unpasteurized Jersey cow’s milk. A young Bonchester is clean and mild in flavor but often develops a stronger and more flavor as it ages. The rind color also deepens from yellow to deep yellow depending on the degree of ripening. Close and smooth in texture, the cheese contains a minimum of 20% milk fat and a maximum of 60% water. Bonchester is a past bronze medal winner at the British Cheese Awards and was Champion Cheese at the Royal Highland Show.
