Buxton Blue

A cousin of Blue Stilton, Buxton Blue is a modern, creamery, blue cheese made from cow's milk. It has thin blue veins running through its body and a wonderful deep russet color that marks its appeal. The interior is pale orange and the flavor has a hint of dark chocolate and burnt onions on the finish. It has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) which requires that only the milk produced in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire be used to make the cheese. The taste and appearance is comparable to Shropshire Blue. Today, the cheese is no longer produced.
