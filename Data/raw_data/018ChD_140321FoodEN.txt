                      Taste profile
Our Swaledale Goats cheese is gently smoked, over oak chippings, for 2 days, the result being a creamy moist cheese with a mild smoked flavour and a rich velvety texture.
 
Type of cheese
Hard pressed yet moist goats milk cheese which is a handmade, farmhouse type. Made using locally sourced milk and vegetarian rennet.
 
Provenance
It is thought that cheese making was first brought to the Yorkshire dales in the 11th century by Cistercian monks who arrived from Normandy and settled in the local abbeys. They in turn passed on the cheese making techniques to the local farmers of Swaledale and thus, Swaledale cheese was born. The Reed family has been making Swaledale cheese in Richmond since 1987. The Swaledale recipe and methods are protected and accredited with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. This is recognised world-wide and safe guards the future production and quality of one of the dales most cherished treasures.
 
Best age & season
Available throughout the year due to the readiness of Swaledale goats milk. Best eaten between 4 and 6 weeks.
