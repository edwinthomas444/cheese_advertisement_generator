Richmond Smoked Cheese Waxed 1.8Kg (approx)
Product Description
Taste profile
Creamy yellow colour with a close but moist texture. The gentle nature of this particular smoking technique creates a mild nutty smoked flavour.
Type of cheese
Hard pressed yet very moist cows milk cheese which is a handmade, farmhouse type. Made using locally sourced milk and vegetarian rennet.
Provenance
It is thought that cheese making was first brought to the Yorkshire dales in the 11th century by Cistercian monks who arrived from Normandy and settled in the local abbeys. They in turn passed on the cheese making techniques to the local farmers of Swaledale and thus, Swaledale cheese was born. The Reed family has been making Swaledale cheese in Richmond since 1987. The Swaledale recipe and methods are protected and accredited with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. This is recognised world wide and safe guards the future production and quality of one of the dales most cherished treasures.
Best age & season
Available throughout the year due to the readiness of Swaledale cows milk. Best eaten at between 4 and 6 weeks old.
Serving suggestions
Our suggestion for this one is to stuff it in a chicken breast with spinach and wrap in Parma ham.
