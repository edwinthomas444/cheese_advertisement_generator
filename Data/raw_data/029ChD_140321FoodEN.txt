White Stilton
Like its Blue brother, White Stilton is a Protected Designation of Origin and can only be made in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire from locally produced milk which must be pasteurised before use. Six dairies are licensed to make White Stilton. It can only be produced in a cylindrical shape and is never pressed. It has a crumbly, open texture with a fresh, creamy background flavour and is best eaten when young at 3 or 4 weeks of age. White Stilton is widely used by blended cheese makers as its crumbly texture and creamy flavour compliment both savoury and sweet additions – the most popular examples being White Stilton with Apricot and White Stilton with Mango and Ginger.
