British Camembert
With a slightly fuller aroma and flavour than British Brie, this cheese is a real treat. As it ripens, the flavour develops depth and complexity and the texture becomes soft and creamy. British Camembert is delicious with a green salad or deep-fried in breadcrumbs. Alternatively, it goes splendidly with a Rioja. The major makers in the UK are Cornish Country Larder near Newquay, Lubborn Creamery near Chard in Somerset and Carmarthenshire Cheese Company with their Pont Gar range.
