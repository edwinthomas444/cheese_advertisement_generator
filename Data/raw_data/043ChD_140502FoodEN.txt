Ashdown Foresters
Made by High Weald Dairy in the Sussex village of Horsted Keynes.

Ashdown Forester takes its name from the Ashdown Forest, a large area of heathland in the High Weald of Sussex, made famous by AA Milne and Winnie the Pooh.

It is an un-pressed cheese, quite firm, with a slightly open texture and has an attractive shape with its basket weave pattern on its surface. Medium in strength, it is a rounded cheese, with a sharp, buttery character and slight saltiness, but with savoury and lemon back notes.

Ashdown Forester takes 8 hours to make, but 3 months to mature in  in carefully controlled conditions.

An organic version of the cheese is available together with Oak Smoked versions of both the standard and the organic.

The cheese can sometimes be found in local National Trust restaurants as well as local markets and delis.
