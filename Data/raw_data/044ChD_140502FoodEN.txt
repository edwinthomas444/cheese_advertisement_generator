ABlacksticks Blue
A branded product made by Butlers Farmhouse Cheese near Preston. This is a soft textured, relatively gentle blue cheese that has gained increasing popularity since its launch in the year 2000. It is made in wheels about 3 inches high, has a distinctive orange colour derived from the addition of annatto to the milk and is reminiscent in texture and flavour of a number of continental blues. This is a "brine salted" rather than "dry salted" cheese.
