Blended Cheeses - More than Just Cheese
Also known as Cheese with bits, Additive Cheese, Fruit and Herb Cheese or More than just Cheese. Blending cheese with herbs and fruits certainly dates back to Roman times and possibly earlier. Today's cheeses are made using traditional English hard and semi hard cheeses( like Wensleydale, White Stilton, Cheddar, Double Gloucester, Lancashire, Cheshire and Red Leicester) which are chopped into small pieces and then blended with the chosen added ingredients. The cheese is then shaped into blocks or wheels and pressed. Most popular varieties are:

Wensleydale and Cranberries

Wensleydale and Blueberries

White Stilton and Apricots

Double Gloucester with Chives and Onions

Cheddar with Caremelised Onions
