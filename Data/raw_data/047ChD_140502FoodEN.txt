Buxton Blue
Buxton Blue is a cousin of Blue Stilton. It is lightly veined and has a wonderful deep russet colouring that hints at the very special tang of its flavour. This cheese is perfect with a chilled glass of sweet dessert wine.

Buxton Blue has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and can only be made in the environs of Buxton from milk produced in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire. It is similar in appearance and taste to Shropshire Blue. Originally made at the now closed Hartington Creamery the cheese is not currently being produced.
