Capricorn Goats Cheese
Soft goat’s milk cheese with a thin white bloomy rind – similar in taste to a young Camembert. As it matures so the curd becomes soft and runny with a complex flavour.
Made at the Lubborn Creamery – home of Somerset Brie - on the Cricket St Thomas estate (home of the TV series "To the Manor Born") near Chard in Somerset. 
 
Ideal as a starter (served warm, with a sweet pickle), in salads or simply as part of a cheeseboard.
