Chevington
Made by Northumberland Cheese Company, Chevington is made from locally produced Jersey milk. It is made in shallow wheels weighing around 5lbs and is matured for between 10 and 12 weeks. The Jersey milk adds a deep yellow colour to the curd and the cheese has a mild creamy flavour inside a hard, knobbly coat.
