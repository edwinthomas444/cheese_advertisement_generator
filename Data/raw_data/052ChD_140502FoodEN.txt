Cornish Blue
Cornish Blue is a flat wheel shaped cheese which is pierced from the top and bottom to help the blue mould do its work. When ripe it has a gentle, creamy flavour and a soft texture reminiscent of a number of Continental blues. It has become increasingly popular helped by numerous cheese show victories, including a victory in the 2004 Tesco Cheese Challenge which gave the cheese its first supermarket listing.
 
Cornish Blue was crowned Champion Cheese at the World Cheese Awards held in Birmingham in November 2010 and was runner up in 2011.
 
Available mainly in specialist cheese shops, some cheesemongers will age the cheese still further to give a drier texture and a much stronger flavour.
