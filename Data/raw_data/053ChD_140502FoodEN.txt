Duddleswell
Made by High Weald Dairy in Sussex.

Duddleswell is a full fat hard cheese made from pasteurised Sheep milk.

It is a well rounded, rich flavoured cheese, with a  mildly acidic taste incorporating ewes milk character, sweet and buttery notes.

Once made, the cheese is matured in carefully controlled conditions, and turned daily for up to five months, until each batch is graded, ready for sale, by the cheese maker. The resulting cheese has a smooth creamy texture and delicious nutty flavour.

The cheese is available in both a standard and Organic format as well as Oak Smoked versions of both.
