Gruyere
Originally made in the Swiss town of the same name, Gruyere is quite similar to Emmental, but has smaller and fewer holes. The name Gruyere - accompanied by its origin - either French or Swiss - is now a protected name and existing producers of Gruyere Cheese not in one of the designated areas of production are only allowed to use the name for few more years. British Gruyere is made in Cheshire. It has a firm, chewy texture and a slightly tangy flavour that adds a delicious zest when used in cooking.This cheese is used as an ingredient in prepared food dishes and sandwiches.
