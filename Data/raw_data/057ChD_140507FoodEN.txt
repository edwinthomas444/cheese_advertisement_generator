Halloumi
Made by High Weald Dairy in Sussex, Halloumi is a salty, brined cheese, originally from the Mediterranean and traditionally and most successfully made from sheep milk. It is widley used in cooking as a meat substitute. Eaten raw it is a distinctly  "squeaky" cheese. However, once dry fried or grilled it takes on a completely different texture and taste, with a texture reminiscent of a grilled marshmallow with a crusty outside and a soft centre and a taste similar to that of bacon.

High Weald Dairy Halloumi is made from 100% sheep milk.
Known as ‘the vegetarian’s alternative to the rasher’, Halloumi is very versatile and makes a good substitute for Tofu.
Being stored in brine, Halloumi is quite a salty cheese; if it is too salty for you, simply rinse it under running water before using it.
Once opened, Halloumi can be kept in fresh water in the fridge for several days, or it can be frozen for up to 3 months.
