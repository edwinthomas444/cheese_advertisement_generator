Hereford Hop
Several versions of Hereford Hop are produced - one made from raw milk and one from pasteurised milk. The cheese is coated in lightly toasted hops which with their slightly bitter taste contrast sharply with the creaminess and slight sweetness of the cheese. Not made in Hereford but in Gloucestershire and Cheshire.
