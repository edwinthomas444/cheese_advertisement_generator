Kidderton Ash
Created by Katy Hollinshead at Raven's Oak Dairy in Cheshire, the soft curds from their goat's milk are ladled by hand into individual moulds and gently drained.  Katy then dusts these with food ash and leaved them to slowly ripen, as a silky white mould coat blooms through the ash. An outstanding goat's cheese with a delicate yet distinctive creamy flavour.
