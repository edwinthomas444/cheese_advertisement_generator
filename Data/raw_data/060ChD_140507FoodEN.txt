Northumberland
Made by Northumberland Cheese Company, the cheese is made to a Gouda style recipe meaning that apart from its round shape it is also brine salted rather than dry salted. It has a springy texture and when sold young has a mild creamy taste. As it ages so the texture becomes firmer and the flavour more complex
