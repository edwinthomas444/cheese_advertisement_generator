Paneer
Asian style springy cheese used widely in Indian cooking as a meat substitute. Produced via direct acidification of the milk rather than by use of bacterial starter cultures. After the curds are formed they are scalded which means that the cheese will not melt when heated. Made by Long Clawson Dairy and Ukay Khoa Manufacturing who are both based in Leicestershire.
