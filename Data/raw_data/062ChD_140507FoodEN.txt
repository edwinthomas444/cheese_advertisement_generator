Parlick Fell
Named after Parlick Fell, a local landmark in the heart of the Singleton's Dairy cheese making territory near Preston in Lancashire, this very popular ewe's milk cheese has a semi-soft, crumbly texture and tangy flavour with a nice touch of salt and a lingering finish. It has a characteristic brilliant white colour.
