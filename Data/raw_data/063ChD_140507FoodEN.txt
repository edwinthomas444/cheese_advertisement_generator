Red Fox
A brand of cheese made by Belton Farm, Red Fox is a modern British classic with a cunningly unexpected crunch! Handmade using a unique recipe developed over many years along with carefully selected starter cultures, the cheese has an intense and complex blend of sweet nd savoury flavours. The russet colour comes from the addition of annatto to the milk and the crunch from the naturally occurring calcium lactate crystals which form as the cheese matures. Red Fox is typically aged for between 14 and 18 months.
