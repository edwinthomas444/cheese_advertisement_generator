Sage Derby

Made to the same recipe as Derby, Sage Derby is one of England’s oldest and most famous cheeses but one that is increasingly difficult to find. The traditional way of making Sage Derby – still exploited by Fowlers Forest Dairy - was to part fill the cheese mould with freshly milled and salted Derby curd, then add a sprinkling of fresh sage and finally add another layer of milled, salted curd. The cheese is then pressed and allowed to mature for up to 6 months. In some cases the outer coat is also dusted with sage. A blended version is also produced by other dairies where dried sage is blended with chopped matured Derby and then repressed.
