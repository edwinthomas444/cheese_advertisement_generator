Slipcote
Made by the High Weald Dairy in the Sussex Village of Horsted Keynes

The name ‘Slipcote’ is an old English word meaning little (slip) piece of cottage (cote) cheese.

Sussex Slipcote has a light fresh creamy texture with a clean slightly sharp lemony taste. It is a mild, soft creamy cheese made with pasteurised sheep milk. It is similar to the French Boursin soft cheese in texture.

The cheese is a spreading cheese well partnered by crusty bread, biscuits, a jacket potato or stirred into pasta.

Other varieites with added flavours such as Garlic and Herb, Peppercorn and Basil are available.
