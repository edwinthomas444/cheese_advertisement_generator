St Giles
Made by High Weald Dairy in Sussex this is a semi soft cheese. Following a "cheese naming" competition in the local area, Saint Giles was born. Saint Giles happens to be the name of the Norman village church in Horsted Keynes.

The cheese is an English equivalent to the continental style Saint Paulin or Port Salut style of cheese found in France.

Saint Giles, made with Organic Cows’ milk from the cows on Tremains farm, is a semi soft creamy cheese. It has a rich, buttery texture, a creamy mild flavour and a stunning edible orange rind.
