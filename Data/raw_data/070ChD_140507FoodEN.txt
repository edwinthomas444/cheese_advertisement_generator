Swaledale Cheese and Swaledale Ewes Cheese
Swaledale cheese has been produced in the Dales for 500 years or more and in texture and taste not unsurprisingly is similar to Wensleydale which is produced in the neighbouring dale. Swaledale and Swaledale Ewes Cheese are both Protected Designations of Origin – the difference being that Swaledale is made from local cows’ milk and the Ewes’ version from locally produced sheep milk. See the section "British Protected Name Cheeses".
