Village Green
Made by Milk Link Cheese (now part of ARLA Foods) at their Reece's Creamery in Malpas, Cheshire, Village Green is a cheddar style cheese made from goat's milk. Its name reflects the green wax coating applied to every cheese. Sold at various ages between 3 months and 18 months, it has a brilliant white colour and sweet nutty flavour that becomes more pronounced as it ages. If you thought you didn't like goat's cheese then this is the one that might change your mind!
