West Country Goats Cheese
This was made to a similar recipe to Village Green by Cornish Country Larder in their Somerset creamery at North Braden; production has ceased following the sale of the creamery although production may start again elsewhere. This was a younger cheeese and devoid of the green wax coat seen on Village Green. It exhibited the same sweet nutty notes and has a brilliant white colour characteristic of most British goats' milk cheeses.
