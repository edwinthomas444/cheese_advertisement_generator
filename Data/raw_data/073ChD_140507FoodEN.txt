Whitehaven
Made by Raven's Oak Dairy in Nantwich from locally produced Goat's milk, Whitehaven is a white mould soft cheese, brine-salted and then sprayed with penicillium candidum white mould.  The curd - as with most goats' cheese - is brilliant white which softens as it ripens from the outside in. It has a mild flavour in which only those with very sensitive taste buds could claim to detect the flavour associated with goat's milk.
