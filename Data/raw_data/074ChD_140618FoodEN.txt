Brue Valley Vintage Cheddar

Full-bodied and smooth with a rich, lasting flavour
Not to be confused with 'Brue Chapel', the Clapp brothers’ creation is made on Brue Valley Farm on the Somerset levels and is full-bodied and smooth with a rich, lasting flavour. A gold medal winner at the World Cheese Awards, they think the secret of their success might lie in playing classical music to their herd of Friesians and the waterbeds they sleep on.
