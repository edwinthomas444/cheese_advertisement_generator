Denhay Traditional Mature Cheddar

A rich and creamy Farmhouse Cheddar with a nutty mellow finish.
Denhay Farm lies in the hills above Lyme Bay in Dorset. The small team at Denhay takes full advantage of the mild maritime climate, abundant rainfall and clay soil to grow the perfect grass for turning into cheesemaking milk. This produces rich and creamy Farmhouse Cheddar with a nutty mellow finish. Denhay also won a Gold medal in the World Cheese Awards.
