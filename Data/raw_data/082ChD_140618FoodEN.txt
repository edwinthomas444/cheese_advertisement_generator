Green's of Glastonbury Double Gloucester

A rich and creamy traditional territorial with a distinct tangy flavour.
Another medal winner made by the Green family at the foot of the Glastonbury Tor. It’s a rich, creamy, traditional territorial with a distinct tangy flavour.  A real regional favourite and a suitably delicious addition to the West Country range.
