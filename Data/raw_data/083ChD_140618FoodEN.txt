Green's Goat's Cheese

A uniquely creamy Goat's Cheese with a nutty flavour and mature finish.
Made using the same traditional methods utilised by all West Country Farmhouse Cheddar makers, but using the distinctive milk from a herd of local goats. Matured for more than 6 months, the resultant cheese has a uniquely creamy and nutty flavour with a long, mature finish.
