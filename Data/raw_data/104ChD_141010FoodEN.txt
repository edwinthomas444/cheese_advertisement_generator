Sharpham Savour

I first encountered this new cheese from Sharpham at their open day. It's 'washed curd' (the method associated with Dutch cheeses), but most excitingly it mixes Sharpham's own Jersey cow milk with goats' milk.

Sharpham don't introduce a new cheese every day of the week - in fact this is the first new cheese they've produced since the Cheese Shed started in 2006.  Generally they concentrate on a limited range of superb quality cheeses which are tried and tested.  If Sharpham introduce a new cheese, it's worth sitting up and taking notice.  Incidentally, these mixed milk cheeses are rare. The late lamented Menallack dairy made several, all of which were good - as is this. In fact we think it's really special - see if you agree.
