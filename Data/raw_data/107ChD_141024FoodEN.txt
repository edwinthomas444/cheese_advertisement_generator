• Is made to a traditional recipe with animal rennet and is crucially hand-ladled. This a more artisan approach than that used to make their widely available standard cheese.
• Only accounts for 10-15% of Cropwell Bishop’s Stilton production.
• The recipe comes from the archive of their old Melton Mowbray North Road Creamery which closed in 1986.
• They only re-instated some production using this traditional recipe in 2010, in order to make the best Stilton available.
• Made by the current generation of the Skailes Family who have been making Stilton cheese for over 160 years.
• Interesting Fact: Mario, one of the staff who hand-ladles the curd has been with Cropwell for over 40 years and used to hand-ladle the curd at the old North Road Creamery.
• Tastes: Caramel, buttery and complex: a slight spice and long lingering notes.
