Ardrahan

A semi-soft, brine washed rind, pasteurised, vegetarian Irish cheese with a mature flavour. Ardrahan is hand-made by Eugene and Mary Burns on their farm in County Cork and can have quite a smooth texture. It has a rich buttery flavour with a zesty tang and an edible full-bodied rind. Ardrahan won a silver medal at the 2001 British Cheese Awards and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve Ardrahan with a selection of Irish cheeses such as Cashel Blue, St Killian and Carrigaline on a cheeseboard with soda bread or oat cakes.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
