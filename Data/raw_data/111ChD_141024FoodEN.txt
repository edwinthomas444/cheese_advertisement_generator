Ashdown Foresters Organic

A full fat, semi-hard pressed pale creamy-coloured cheese with a natural honey coloured rind. It is made in the Ashdown Forest at Duddleswell, East Sussex from locally produced organic pasteurised cow's milk. Ashdown Foresters Organic cheese is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at the Crowborough, Burgess Hill, Sevenoaks, Horsham, Hailsham and Paddock Wood branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve on a cheeseboard or use in sandwiches or salads.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
