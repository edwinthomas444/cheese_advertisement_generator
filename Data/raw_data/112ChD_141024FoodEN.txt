Ashmore Farmhouse

A hand-made locally produced hard cheese with a really smooth texture, similar to Cheddar but with a richer and creamier taste. Ashmore Farmhouse Cheese was a bronze medal winner at the British Cheese Awards in 2001. It is made in Ashmore, Wiltshire from unpasteurised cow's milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve with wholemeal bread and tomato relish or grate and add to salads, use to top baked potatoes or simply eat with slices of eating apple.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
