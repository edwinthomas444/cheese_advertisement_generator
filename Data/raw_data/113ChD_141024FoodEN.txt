Beaufort

A full fat hard French cheese made from unpasteurised cows milk. Beaufort is known as 'the prince of Gruyères' and has a fruity aroma with a rich flavour and a smooth creamy, buttery texture. Beaufort is available prepacked as part of the Select range from Waitrose.

Uses: Beaufort is an excellent melting cheese and can be incorporated into cooked dishes or sprinkled over the top. It is ideal for serving as part of a cheeseboard.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard, remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
