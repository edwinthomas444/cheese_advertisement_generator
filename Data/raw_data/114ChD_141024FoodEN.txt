Berkswell

A hard ewe's milk cheese which won a gold medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001 and was originally developed from a Caerphilly cheese recipe. It is hand-made at Ram Hall in Berkswell, Warwickshire and has a rich, full flavour with a buttery lingering flavour. It is similar to a mature Pecorino or Manchego cheese. Berkswell is made from unpasteurised milk and is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Berkswell can be served on a cheeseboard or grated and added to soups, sauces or pasta dishes.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
