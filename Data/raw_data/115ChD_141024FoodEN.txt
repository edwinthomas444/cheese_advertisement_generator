Blue

A blue cheese is a creamy white-coloured cheese which has blue veins running through it. The veins are formed when a mould culture is added to milk at the beginning of the cheese-making process. Blue cheeses have a tangy, piquant, spicy and peppery flavour. Hard Blue cheeses include: Dorset Blue Vinny, Shropshire Blue, Stilton, and Wensleydale(individual descriptions are found alphebetically in this glossary). Blue cheese is made from pasteurised milk and is available prepacked or from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: In salad dressings, in cooking or simply served with bread or biscuits.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard, remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
