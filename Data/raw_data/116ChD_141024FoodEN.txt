Gorwydd Caerphilly

A clean and fresh sweet Caerphilly cheese with a creamy, crumbly texture made by Todd Trethowen near Llanddewi Brefi, Tregaron in Dyfed. Gorwydd Caerphilly has a grey moulded rind which can have distinctive vivid yellow or orange splodges, it is made from unpasteurised Teifi valley milk that is left to mature for 2 months to give it lasting flavour and is suitable for vegetarians. It won a gold medal at the 2001 British Cheese Awards for the Best Territorial Cheese and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve on its own or use in cooking to make Glamorgan sausages, Welsh Rarebit or a cheese and leek sauce to serve with chicken or cod.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
