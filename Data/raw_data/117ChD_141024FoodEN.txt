Coombe Farm Organic Cheddar

Coombe Farm Cheddar is made in the traditional way, using milk produced under organic standards. Choose from Mature Cheddar, a full flavoured distinctive mature cheese or Medium Cheddar, a mellow tangy flavoured medium cheese. Coombe Farm Cheddar is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available prepacked from Waitrose.

Uses: Include in cooking in recipes such as cheese straws, cheese and onion quiche or pasties or serve with organic celery and a selection of organic dried fruit and nuts on a cheeseboard.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
