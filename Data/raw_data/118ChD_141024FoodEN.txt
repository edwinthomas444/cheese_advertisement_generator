Country Larder English Goat's Cheddar

This cheese is unusual in that unlike most Cheddar it is made from goat's milk rather than cow's milk. It is matured for at least 10 months to produce a full flavoured cheese that has a fruity, clean flavour with a slightly crumbly texture. Country Larder English Goat's Cheddar is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available prepacked from Waitrose.

Uses: Ideal as a useful alternative for anyone avoiding cow's milk, English Goat's Cheddar can be used in exactly the same way as cow's milk Cheddar. Use in cooking, in sandwiches, on a cheeseboard or simply cut into cubes and serve as a quick snack.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
