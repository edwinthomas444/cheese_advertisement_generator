Cricketer Half Fat Traditional Mature

Cricketer Farm has been making award-winning Cheddar for over 50 years and now they've developed a variety that has 50% less fat than a conventional Cheddar. Cricketer Half Fat Mature Cheese has all the character of a farmhouse Cheddar and a well-developed flavour. It is made at Stowey Court Farm in the village of Nether Stowey near Bridgewater in Somerset. Cricketer Half Fat Traditional Mature Cheese is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Grate Cricketer Half Fat Mature Cheese and use in cooking or to top baked potatoes or slice and use in sandwiches.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
