Davidstow Cheddar

Davidstow Cheddar has been made in north Cornwall for over 50 years to a traditional recipe. Davistow Cheddar is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians. Mature Davidstow is specially matured and selected to give a smooth, rich and creamy full-bodied flavour, at the 2001 British Cheese Awards it won a silver medal. It is available prepacked and from the service counter at Waitrose. Extra Mature Davidstow Cheddar is a well-developed Cheddar which has been selected to give a unique, rich, fuller flavour.

Uses: Serve Mature or Extra Mature Davidstow Cheddar in traditional West country style with a chunk of crusty bread and a glass of cider. Create a Cornish cheeseboard and serve with Cornish Brie and Cornish Village Green Goat's Cheese.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
