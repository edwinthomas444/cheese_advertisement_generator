Waitrose offer a choice of own label English Cheddars, choose from Mild English Cheddar which has a creamy flavour and a smooth body and a close texture. It is a young cheese and very versatile, it is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available prepacked and from the service counter. Medium English Cheddar is a firm-bodied cheese with a more developed creamy flavour and is also available prepacked in blocks, ready grated (in 250g packs), ready sliced (10 slices per pack) and from the service counter. Mature English Cheddar is a full bodied cheese with a slightly nutty flavour, it is available prepacked in blocks and ready grated (in 250g packs), from Waitrose. Mild, medium and mature prepacked block Cheddar are all made by Coombe Farm. This gives them their distinctive fine aroma and flavour as a farmhouse cheesemaker's expertise is used to produce a creamery Cheddar.

Uses: Mild English Cheddar is ideal for sandwiches or salads where a subtle cheese flavour is required, it is ideal as a snack for children. Medium English Cheddar can be used to flavour soups, sauces, stuffings and soufflés. Use Mature English Cheddar where a strong Cheddar flavour is required, sprinkle over baked potatoes or include in quiches and pies.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
