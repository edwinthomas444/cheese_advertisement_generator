Farmhouse Cheesemakers Cheddar

Farmhouse Cheesemakers Cheddar is a West Country Farmhouse Cheddar which has Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) protection, this means it has been made using local milk from one of four West country counties, (Dorset, Somerset, Devon or Cornwall). The PDO acts as a guarantee that the cheese has been made on the farm by hand, using authenticated methods. It is suitable for vegetarians, choose from: West Country Farmhouse Mature Cheddar (available prepacked from Waitrose) or Premium Handmade Traditional Unpasteurised Cheddar, also available prepacked from Waitrose.

Uses: Include in cheese sauce to serve with cod and mashed potatoes, sprinkle over tacos or use to make cheese pastry for pies or pasties. Serve on a cheeseboard with black and green grapes as an alternative to dessert.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
