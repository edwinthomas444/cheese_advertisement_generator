Green's Farmhouse Cheddar

Made in Glastonbury since 1920 by the Green family, Green's Cheddar is a West Country Farmhouse Cheddar which has Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) protection, this means it has been made using local milk from one of four West country counties, (Dorset, Somerset, Devon or Cornwall). The PDO acts as a guarantee that the cheese has been made on the farm by hand, using authenticated methods. Green's Glastonbury Farmhouse Cheddar is a full flavoured, tangy cheese with a subtle hint of onions. Green's Organic Farmhouse Cheddar has a full, strong, mature flavour and a pleasing, open texture. This Cheddar is still made in 50lb cylinders that are cloth bound, rather than in modern blocks. Both varieties of Green's Farmhouse Cheddar are made from pasteurised milk, are suitable for vegetarians and are available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve with organic biscuits or bread, grate and mix with wholegrain mustard to make cheese on toast or use to make cheese scones.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
