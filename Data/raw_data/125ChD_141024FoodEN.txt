Keens West Country Farmhouse Cheddar

The Keen family have been making cheese at Moorhayes Farm, Wincantonin Somerset for over 100 years. Keens Cheddar is made in the traditional way using unpasteurised milk from their own herd of cows. It has a moist texture with a tangy bite and a full-bodied flavour. Keens Cheddar is a West Country Farmhouse Cheddar which has Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) protection, this means it has been made using local milk from one of four West country counties, (Somerset, Dorset, Devon or Cornwall). The PDO acts as a guarantee that the cheese has been made on the farm by hand, using authenticated methods. Keens West Country Farmhouse Cheddar won a bronze medal at the 2001 British Cheese Awards and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve simply with biscuits or bread and a glass of red wine or cider or include on a cheeseboard. Keens is also ideal for use in cooking and adds a rich flavour to sauces, bakes and pies.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
