Montgomery's Cheddar

This full-flavoured Cheddar is made at Manor Farm in North Cadbury, Somerset. Three generations of the Montgomery family have used the same ingredients and hand-made methods since 1912 to produce a Cheddar cheese with a deep nutty flavour and crisp texture. Montgomery's Cheddar is matured over 12 months in muslin bandages to produce the strong, full flavour. It is made from unpasteurised milk and is available as part of the Waitrose Select range of prepacked cheeses.

Uses: Serve Montgomery's Cheddar on a cheeseboard with fresh figs or slices of melon, or grate and use to make a delicious flavoured cheese bread or sprinkle over wild mushroom risotto.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
