Appleby's Cheshire

The Appleby family have a history of cheesemaking that spans several generations. A combination of fine quality milk, the skill of the cheesemaker and the art of maturing gives this cheese its unique texture and flavour. Appleby's Cheshire is hand-made from unpasteurised milk at Hawkstone Abbey Farm on the edge of the Cheshire plain. It is the only hand-made cloth bound Cheshire to be produced in the old-fashioned way. Appleby's is available prepacked as part of the Waitrose Select range of cheeses and is suitable for vegetarians.

Uses: Serve with a selection of cheeses such as Cornish Brie, Stilton and Cheddar to create an English cheeseboard. Or serve simply with grapes or apple slices. Cheshire cheese was traditionally served with rich fruit cake.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
