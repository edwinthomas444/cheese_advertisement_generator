Cornish Yarg

A mild flavoured semi-hard cow's milk vegetarian cheese with a slight citrus tang, Cornish Yarg has a moist and supple texture and is named after the couple who first made it (Yarg is Gray spelt backwards). The cheese is wrapped in nettles which give it a very subtle flavour and also provides an attractive colour contrast to the creamy white interior. As the cheese develops a natural greyish mould may develop on the nettles. Cornish Yarg won a gold medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001 for the Best Flavour Added Cheese. It is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at 110 branches of Waitrose

Uses: Serve with a selection of British cheeses on a cheeseboard or slice and serve with warm bread, sliced apple or pear and a fruity chutney.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
