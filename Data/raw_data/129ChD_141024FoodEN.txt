Curworthy

A creamy-textured, full flavoured traditional farmhouse hard cheese that has an open texture and a rich buttery taste that develops with age. Based on a 17th century recipe, Curworthy cheese is hand-made by Rachel Stevens on Stockbeare Farm near Okehampton in Devon. It is made with the unpasteurised milk from the farm's own Friesian cows and is matured for three to four months. Curworthy has a distinctive black wax coating. It is available prepacked as part of the Select range of cheeses at Waitrose.

Uses: Serve on a cheeseboard or use in cooking, Curworthy is a particularly good melting cheese and can be grated and sprinkled over potato topped pies, omelettes or cauliflower cheese before melting under a preheated grill.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
