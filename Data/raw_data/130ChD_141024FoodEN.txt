Devon Oke

A locally produced creamy textured, full bodied, pasteurised cow's milk cheese, Devon Oke is a mature Curworthy cheese. It is handmade by Rachel Stevens at Stockbearne Farm near Okehampton (hence its name) in Devon using milk from the farm's own Friesian cows. Devon Oke is available from the service counter at selected branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Devon Oke can be served on a cheeseboard or grated and included in sauces, salads, sandwiches or sprinkled over pasta bakes or potato topped pies and grilled.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
