Double Worcester

A full fat hard cheese with a robust and mellow flavour and a rich golden colour, Double Worcester won a silver medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001. Double Worcester has a really smooth, light texture with a subtle citrus tang and is a smaller version of Double Gloucester. It is made by Colin and Alyson Anstey at Broomhall Farm, Worcester, which has been in their family for four generations. Double Worcester is made from unpasteurised milk and is suitable for vegetarians, it is available from the service counter at 55 branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Double Worcester can be served on a cheeseboard or used for grilling or sauces.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
