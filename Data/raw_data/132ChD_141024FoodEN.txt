Fowlers Sage Derby

A farm-made mature Derby cheese which is layered and topped with a sprinkling of fresh sage which gives it its subtle green colour. Made by Fowlers of Earlswood in the West Midlands, Derby cheese has a nutty mature taste that goes well with the herby sage flavour. Fowlers Sage Derby won a silver medal at the 2001 British Cheese Awards and is made from pasteurised milk and is available from the service counter at 109 branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve with crusty bread and pickles as part of a ploughman's lunch or add to sauces, pasta dishes or quiches.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
