Goat's cheese:
Village Green Goat's Cheese

A full fat, clean and fruity hard vegetarian goat's cheese with a smooth texture. It is similar in texture and taste to a mild Cheddar and has a subtle roasted nut flavour. Village Green is made with pasteurised milk and is covered in a distinctive green wax. It is available from the service counter at 124 branches of Waitrose and is suitable for vegetarians.

Uses: Ideal as a useful alternative for anyone avoiding cow's milk. Good served with a selection of cheeses such as Cornish Yarg, Dorset Blue Vinny and Somerset Brie for a West country cheeseboard. Or simply serve with slices of apple and a glass of red wine.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
