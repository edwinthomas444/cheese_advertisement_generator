Woolsery Goat's Cheese

A moist, open textured semi-hard modern British cheese with a subtle but distinctive goat's milk taste that hints of almonds and pinenuts. Woolsery Goat's Cheese is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is locally produced near Sydling St Nicholas in Dorset and won the Cheese Lovers Trophy at the British Cheese Awards in 2001. It is available from the service counter at the Gillingham (Dorset), Ringwood and Salisbury branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve with green grapes and slices of apple and biscuits or drizzle with a little honey and balsamic vinegar and grill until just melting, serve with crusty bread.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard, remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
