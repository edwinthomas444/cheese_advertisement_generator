Kirkham's Lancashire

This award winning cheese is individually hand-made from unpasteurised milk at the Kirkham's family farm in Goosnargh on the slopes of Beacon Fell in the heart of Lancashire. It is made using three day curd to give a subtly mottled, unique texture. Each cheese is handturned and rubbed to develop the unique rind. Kirkham's Lancashire is part of the Select range of prepacked cheeses available from Waitrose and is available from 62 branches.

Uses: Serve simply with biscuits and celery or use to make really creamy cheese on toast.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
