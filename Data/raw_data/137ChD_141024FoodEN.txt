Lincolnshire Poacher

A robust full-flavoured hard cheese made from unpasteurised milk from Holstein cows. Lincolnshire poacher has a similar earthy flavour to Cheddar but has a more open texture, it is pale yellow in colour and has an inedible grainy brown rind. It won a gold medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001 and is available from the service counter at the Daventry and Newark branches of Waitrose.

Uses: It is suitable for grating and grilling or can be served in chunks with pickled onions and crusty bread for a quick lunch.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
