Little Derby

A strong-tasting hard cheese that has a buttery appearance with an orange rind, Little Derby was a bronze medal winner at the British Cheese Awards in 2001. Little Derby is so called not because of its size (the individual cheeses are around 40cm in diameter and weigh over 10kg) but because it is made outside Derbyshire it is made in Earlswood in Warwickshire by the Fowler family. Little Derby is a locally produced cheese made from pasteurised milk and is available from the service counter at the Hall Green, Kidderminster, Evington, Blaby, Sutton Coldfield, Stourbridge and Great Malvern branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Little Derby can be used in similar ways to Cheddar, it is ideal for cooking and grating or for serving on the cheeseboard. On its own it goes very well with either a glass of beer or red wine.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
