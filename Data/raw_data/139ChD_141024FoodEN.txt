Malvern Ewe's Milk Cheese

A sweet ewe's milk vegetarian cheese with a nutty flavour and a buttery texture made from pasteurised milk. Malvern ewe's milk cheese is made by Nick Hodgetts near Malvern in Worcestershire. This locally produced cheese is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at the Kidderminster, Witney, Stourbridge, Stroud, Cirencester and Great Malvern branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Malvern can be served cooked or uncooked. Serve with slices of apple and pear and a glass of dry cider or grate and add to quiches, sauces or omelettes.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
