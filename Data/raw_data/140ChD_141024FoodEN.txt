Meldon

A type of Curworthy cheese (see separate entry) flavoured with wholegrain mustard and Chiltern ale. Meldon has a creamy texture which complements the mustard and ale flavourings. It is made from pasteurised milk and is suitable for vegetarians. It is handmade at Stockbearne Farm near Okehampton in Devon using milk from the farm's own Friesian cows. This locally produced cheese is available from the service counter at the Okehampton, Saltash and Sidmouth branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve with crusty white bread and a glass of real ale for a simple lunch or grate and use to make cheese on toast. Meldon makes a tasty addition to a cheeseboard serve with a selection of other West country cheeses such as Cornish Yarg, Somerset Camembert and Dorset Blue Vinny.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
