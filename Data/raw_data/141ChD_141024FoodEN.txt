Norfolk White Lady

A soft, slightly sharp sheep's milk cheese. Norfolk White Lady is a locally produced cheese and is hand-made at Poppylot Farm in Feltwell near Norfolk. It is made from unpasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at the Peterborough, St Ives (Cambridgshire), Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket, Huntingdon, Ely, Eaton, Trumpington and Wymondham branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve on a cheeseboard with a selection of English cheeses or with wholemeal bread and slices of apple for a quick lunch.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
