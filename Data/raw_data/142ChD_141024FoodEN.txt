Cropwell Bishop Shropshire Blue

Made in the village of Cropwell Bishop in Nottinghamshire at a small family run creamery this Shropshire Blue is a well-balanced cheese with a medium spicy flavour. Cropwell Bishop Shropshire Blue won two gold medals at the British Cheese Awards in 2001 for Best Blue and Best Traditional British Cheese. It is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Shropshire Blue makes an impressive-looking table cheese serve with a selection of English cheeses on a cheeseboard. Add to baked potatoes or cheese sauce for a rich, tasty result.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
