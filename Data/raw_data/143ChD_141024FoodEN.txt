Single Gloucester

Single Gloucester is a light, crumbly hard cheese, lower in fat than the more widely available Double Gloucester and suitable for vegetarians. This locally produced vegetarian cheese has a subtle buttery flavour and a hint of sweetness. Single Gloucester is a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese which guarantees it has been made on the farm by hand, using authenticated methods. Single Gloucester is made with unpasteurised cow's milk by Charles Martell at Laurel Farm, Dymock, Gloucestershire. It won a gold medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001 and is available from the service counter at the Witney, Stroud, Monmouth, Cirencester and Great Malvern branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Single Gloucester is a versatile cheese, serve in sandwiches, with bread as a ploughman's lunch or grate and use to make cheese on toast, sprinkle over soups, pasta dishes or salads.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
