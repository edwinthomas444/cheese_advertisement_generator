Mature Blue Stilton

Waitrose Mature Blue Stilton is matured for a richer, fuller flavour with a creamy texture and extensive blue veins. It won a silver medal at the 2001 British Cheese Awards. It is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available prepacked from Waitrose.

Uses: Serve on a cheeseboard with a selection of other English cheeses such as Cheddar, Lancashire and Cornish Brie. Serve in crusty rolls with a sweet, fruity chutney or crumble and toss with crisply cooked bacon, cooked pasta and a little olive oil.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
