Sussex Yeoman

A hard-pressed goat's milk vegetarian cheese, with a moist, but crumbly texture, and distinctly nutty flavour. Sussex Yeoman is made at Nut Knowle Farm near Horam in East Sussex. It is made from pasteurised milk, is suitable for vegetarians and is available from the service counter at Waitrose.

Uses: Sussex Yeoman is suitable for use on a cheeseboard or in cooking.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
