Swaledale

A creamy full flavoured cow's milk traditional Yorkshire cheese with an earthy almost grassy taste. It has a subtle acidity and is softer and moister than Wensleydale which is produced in the next valley. Swaledale is hand-made in Richmond, the gateway to Swaledale, by David and Mandy Reed and is left open to the air to mature which results in a hard, natural rind with a bluey grey mould. It is suitable for vegetarians, made using pasteurised milk and is available from the service counter at selected branches of Waitrose. Swaledale won a silver medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001.

Uses: Use Swaledale to make cheese and pickle sandwiches, or serve it with tomato chutney, celery and wholemeal bread.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard, remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
