Warwickshire Truckle

A full flavoured mature cheese with a firm but creamy texture. Warwickshire Truckle is locally produced at Fowlers Forest Dairies in Earlswood. It is made from pasteurised milk and is available from the service counter at the Hall Green, Kidderminster, Sutton Coldfield, Stourbridge and Great Malvern branches of Waitrose.

Uses: Serve sliced in crusty rolls with a fruity pickle and a glass of real ale or serve instead of Cheddar on a cheeseboard with a selection of British cheeses.

To eat: If serving on a cheeseboard, remove the cheese from the fridge an hour before serving, to allow it to come to room temperature and to develop its full texture and flavour.
