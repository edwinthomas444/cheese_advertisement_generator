Baron Bigod is a creamy, white bloomy-rind cheese and UK's only raw milk farmhouse Brie made by Jonathan and Dulcie Crickmore in Bungay, Suffolk, England. It is made from unpasteurized milk of red and white Montbeliarde cows that graze the lush marshes of Stow Fen. The cheese is ladled only by hand and aged for up to 8 weeks in a natural, cave-like environment.

A handmade cheese, Baron Bigod has a smooth, delicate silky texture and golden paste with long lasting warm earth, farmyard and mushroom flavours.
