Acorn cheese is a hard, full fat cheese made entirely from Friesland sheep's milk by Karen and Don Ross at their Little Acorn farmhouse at Bethania in Ceredigion. The cheese is made from unpasteurised sheep's milk using vegetarian rennet. It has a firm, crumbly texture with herbaceous flavour complemented by deep notes of cream caramel, crushed nuts and a citrus finish. The cheese ripens in three to six months. Traditional Welsh vegetables and leeks go well with the cheese.
