Abbot's Gold, also known by other names such as 'Caramelised Onion Cheddar' or 'English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions', is a traditional English cheese made by the historic Wensleydale Creamery in England. Creamy, classic Cheddar infused with rich, sweet caramelised onions tastes of tangy onion soup with an amazing burst of flavour.
