Appleby's Double Gloucester is a traditional, full fat, hard cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk. It uses the same ingredients as Appleby’s Cheshire but with variations in the timing, temperature and acidity. It has a smooth and buttery texture with a rich and nutty yet delicate flavour. The acidity is less dominant than in Cheshire and is balanced with a slight tang and mineral bite. This cheese is suitable for vegetarians as it uses vegetarian rennet.
