Applewood is a traditional farmhouse Cheddar from Ilchester. An English cheese, it also goes by the name of Applewood smoked cheddar. This dense semi-hard cheese was first invented in 1965 in Somerset, England.

Applewood is not actually smoked but given an artificial smoky flavouring with a dusting of paprika for a golden-amber appearance. The cheese can be crumbled or grated over pasta or melted on pork chops for that divine smokey taste. It also goes well with sweet apples and raisins.
