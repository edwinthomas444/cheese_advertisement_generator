Bartlett is an unpasteurized sheep's milk cheese made by brothers James & Dave Bartlett at their farm in Somerset. It is a soft, mould-ripened cheese with a wrinkled, creamy- coloured, and aromatic coat of Geotrichum candidum.  Aged for about 3-4 weeks, the cheese ripens outside-in as the moulds and yeasts digest the fats and proteins within. It has a smooth and dense paste with a complex flavour augmented by the dense richness of the sheep's milk. Flavours are a subtle balance between buttery lactic notes and savoury dried-tobacco-leaf aromas.
