Basing is a Caerphilly-style organic cheese made from unpasteurised goat's milk at a Lower Basing Farm in Kent. It is a modern farmhouse cheese, lightly pressed to retain its moist and crumbliness. The cheese ripens within two months with mild and pleasant acidity, as well a hint of the herbaceous goat's milk. It becomes smooth and creamier as it matures. It contains vegetarian rennet, and served with Pancherenc du Vic-Bih.
