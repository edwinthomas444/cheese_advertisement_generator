Bath Soft cheese is a modern, farmhouse, vegetarian, soft-white cheese made from cow's milk. Produced by cheese-making veteran Graham Padfield, this brie style cheese is soft and runny with a white bloomy rind. The flavours are earthy, mushroomy and aromatic underpinned by citrusy and grassy notes. Though very like brie, it is less chalky and fresher to taste. The recipe for Bath Soft dates to 1801 at the time of Admiral Lord Nelson when he received it as a gift from his father.

The 4” square cheese made with pasteurised milk comes attractively wrapped in parchment paper with a red wax seal. Bath Soft cheese pairs excellently with Champagne and Sparkling Vouvray.
