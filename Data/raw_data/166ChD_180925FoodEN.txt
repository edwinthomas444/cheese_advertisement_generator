Bermondsey Hard Pressed is a hard-pressed, hard-rind unpasteurized cow's milk cheese made by Bill Oglethorpe, an urban cheesemaker in London. It is an Alpine-style cheese with a texture that is slightly creamier than Cheddar and dotted with irregular eyes or holes. Flavours are 'farmyardy' with a lot of complexity thrown in. Enjoy the cheese with a Kernel Pale Ale.
