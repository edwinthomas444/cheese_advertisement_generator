Bishop Kennedy is named after a 15th century bishop of St Andrews. It originated from the medieval monasteries in France. This cheese is made from unpasteurised cow's milk, using vegetable rennet. Bishop Kennedy is a soft cheese, with a runny, yellow interior. It is aged for 8 weeks. The rind is first washed with brine and then with whiskey.

When ripe, the texture is runny, sticky with a yellowish orange colour.
