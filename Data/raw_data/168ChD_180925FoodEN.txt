Blacksticks Blue is a farmhouse soft blue veined cheese made from pasteurised milk of the Butlers family herd of pedigree cows. Rightly been depicted as the "daddy of blue cheeses", it is handmade at the Butlers' Inglewhite Dairy in rural Lancashire.

The cheese is aged for about eight weeks during which it develops a distinctive amber hue along with a delicious creamy smooth yet tangy taste. It is soft enough to spread on to a slice of bread or cracker as well as used in cooking.
