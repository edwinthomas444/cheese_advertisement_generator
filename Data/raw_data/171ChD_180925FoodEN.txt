Made by Traditional Cheese Dairy in Stonegate East Sussex, Burwash Rose is a semi-soft cheese developed on the lines of British monastic cheeses. Grass fed, free-range raw milk from British Frisian cows is used to make the award-winning rich, soft and creamy cheese.

As the name suggests, Burwash Rose is washed in English rose water from Wadhurst during the first few weeks of its maturation process. This gives the full flavoured cheese a build up of wonderful orange sticky and distinctly floral-scented rind. This cheese has an amazing bouncy texture which dresses up beautifully on the cheeseboard. A melt-in-the-mouth cheese, it also tastes delicious when served with walnut bread.
