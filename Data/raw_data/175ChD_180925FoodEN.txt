Cardo is a semi soft, unpasteurized goat's milk cheese made by Mary Holbrook on her Sleight Farm, near Timsbury, Somerset. The cheese is aged at Neal's Yard Dairy for several weeks during which they are periodically washed with a brine solution. This results in a sticky, orange coating of Brevibacterium linens which gives the rind its pungency and savouriness. The paste is deep ivory with small eyes throughout and a runny breakdown just beneath the grey-orange rind. Flavours are delicate, floral typically associated with goat's cheeses.

It pairs well with earthy, leathery red wines.
