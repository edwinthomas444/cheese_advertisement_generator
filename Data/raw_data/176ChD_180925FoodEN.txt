Celtic Promise is an award-winning, Caerphilly type washed-rind cheese made by John Savage of Teifi Farmhouse Cheese in Ceredigion, Wales. After the cheese is hand made by John Savage on his farmhouse, it is matured at Eastside in East Sussex by Pat Jackson. Because the cheese is hand-made by the Teifi cheesemaker, each batch will vary slightly from the next. An unpasteurised, semi-soft cheese made from cows' milk, it is shaped like a dumpling and has a fat content of 48%. It has previously been a champion at the British Cheese Awards in 2005.

During the process, the cheese is ripened in cider to get the slightly moist, sticky orange-red rind and fruity smell. As this cheese ripens in about eight weeks, the soft buttery texture develops a pungent aroma and a delicate, mild flavour. The cheese is suitable for vegetarians.

Celtic Promise is best enjoyed on a cheeseboard and goes well with cider.
