Cerney Pyramid is a medium fat soft goat's cheese handmade by artisans in the Cotswolds, just north of Cirencester, England. The recipe for Cerney was created by Lady Angus of Gloucestershire in 1983, inspired by Valencay cheese from the Loire valley.

The cheese is shaped like a truncated pyramid coated with oak ash/sea salt mix. It takes 3 days to make the cheese and has a shelf life of approximately four weeks. When 1 or 2 weeks old, Cerney has a soft mousse like texture and a fresh mild flavour. The cheese develops deeper flavour as it ages. The shape and production of Cerney is very similar to Valencay, but the taste is very different with less of a goat flavour. The cheese is available in many different varieties including peppermix rolled, brandy washed and fresh rounds intended for grilling.

Cerney Pyramid has been consistently awarded gold, silver & bronze medals at the World Cheese Awards. It has also won the popular title Supreme Champion in 2001 at the Global Cheese Awards. 

This celebrated cheese has won Super gold award at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.
