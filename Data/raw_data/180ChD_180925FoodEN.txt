Chorlton Cheshire Cheeses are award-winning cheeses made using traditional methods without any mechanical equipment. The company produces four types of Cheshire cheeses – traditional Cheshire cheese, coloured Cheshire cheese, smoked Cheshire cheese and Blue Cheshire cheese.

Blue Cheshire cheese is a typical blue veined cheese made using traditional hand crafted methods. The creamy, crumbly cheese with striking blue spider veins is matured for 60 days to develop flavours, which are a fresh lemony tang and a salty lingering taste on the palate.
