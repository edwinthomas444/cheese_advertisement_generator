Colston Bassett is one of the smallest dairies in the United Kingdom. They make their pasteurized cow's milk Stilton the traditional way using hand-ladled curd and animal rennet, not to be found at any other Stilton maker. Thus, the texture of Colston Bassett Stilton is more luscious, creamy and full-bodied and the flavour, more complex and deeper than any other cheese produced with vegetable rennet.

It has a close, creamy texture with pale, ivory paste that edges onto amber as it gets close to the rind and a homogeneous distribution of blue coloured veins. The wrinkly rind is slightly sticky, orange-brown in colour, speckled with patches of white mould. Flavour-wise, Colston Bassett Stilton is earthy and lactic, balanced by the richness of blue mould and butter. When young, it tends to be slightly tangy, but this will disappear as the cheese matures.

This celebrated cheese has won gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards.
