Cornish Brie is a handmade British cheese made by Cornish Country Larder at their farm in Cornwall. It is rich, brie style cheese with a distinctive yellow, buttery pate. The creamery uses full fat, pasteurised cow’s milk sourced from Cornwall to make this deliciously mild yet creamy cheese. Cornish Brie presents itself well on a cheeseboard but also blends brilliantly with a salad, sandwich or for grilling.
