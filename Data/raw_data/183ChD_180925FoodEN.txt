Cote Hill Blue is an unpasteurised cow's milk cheese made by Michael and Mary Davenport at their Cote Hill Farm in Lincolnshire. The couple milk their herd of Friesian cows twice a day and use the milk from the morning's milking to make this cheese.

Cote Hill Blue is a soft and creamy textured blue cheese, similar in style to blue brie. As it is injected with Penicillium roqueforti and later rubbed in salt, the cheese enjoys a definite salty sharpness, whilst leaving behind a buttery sweetness and understated kick in the mouth. The use of raw milk makes the cheese rich in butterfat and protein.

Cote Hill Blue cheese is best enjoyed within 10 days of opening. It tastes great on baked potatoes, as part of lasagne or as a cheese snack.

This unique cheese won a gold medal at the British Cheese Awards after their first year of production. It has also won Super Gold award at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.
