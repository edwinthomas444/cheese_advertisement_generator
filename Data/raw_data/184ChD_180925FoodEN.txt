Created by Joan and Alwin Cross in Teesdale, Cotherstone cheese is related to Wensleydale and Swaledale, and named after a village and parish in County Durham in England.

Suitable for vegetarians, this semi-hard, farmhouse cheese is made from unpasteurised, full-fat Jersey cow’s milk. Cotherstone belongs to a group called ‘Dale style’ cheeses which are soft and crumby in texture, lemony and slightly tangy to taste and tend to be eaten younger.

There are two versions of Cotherstone - a white version and blue-veined version which is sometimes referred to as "Yorkshire Stilton".

Cotherstone is normally used in the preparation of tarts and pastry dishes. It teams well with a Sauvignon.
