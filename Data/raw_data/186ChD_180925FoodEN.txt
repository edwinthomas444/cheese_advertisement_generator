Cottage cheese has a mild flavour and is a cheese curd product. The curd is drained but not pressed, so some whey remains and retains moisture. The curd is generally washed to remove the acidity and leave a sweet taste. It is made from different types of milk with different fat levels.

The term 'cottage cheese' is believed to have originated because the cheese was generally made in cottages from milk left over, after making butter. Cottage cheese can be eaten by itself, with fruits, toast or even used in salads. The cheese is creamy, lumpy and sold in pots.
