Cranborne is a Camembert-style soft, white, mould-ripened cheese, made using unpasteurized cow's milk and traditional animal rennet. When ripe, it has a lovely creamy texture that does not tend to run. The bloomy rind enveloping the pate has an aromatic 'mushroomy' scent.

Cranborne has always been wonderful on a cheese board, but also tastes delicious when studded with garlic or served with some artisan crusty bread.
