Cremet is a mould-ripened brie-like goat's milk cheese enriched with cows' cream for a double cream experience. Officially launched in 2013, it is one of the most recent additions to Sharpham line of cheeses.

This is a soft, smooth cheese with a white and bloomy rind draping the mousy white paste. When young, Cremet is subtle and delicate with a fresh, creamy flavour that evolves into a rich, earthy cheese as it matures. 

The cheese has won many awards, including gold at World Cheese Awards 2013, silver at British Cheese Awards 2014 and bronze at Taste of the West Awards 2014.
