Cropwell Bishop Blue Stilton is traditional Stilton handmade from cow's milk using methods that have changed very little since the 17th century. Both traditional and Organic Blue Stilton are created using vegetarian rennet, meaning both are suitable for vegetarians.

The rich and creamy stilton is typically rubbed with salt mid-process and aged for 12 weeks to mature. This cultivates a rich and tangy cheese with a unique, strong flavour developed by the blue mould spores added to the milk. It offers a melt in the mouth feel and velvety soft texture. The cheese is crumbly yet firm and has a dry brown wrinkled rind around a creamy ivory paste with blue veins that spread all the way to the edges.

This genuine classic tastes delicious with fresh, crusty bread, with any sweet chutney or jam, honey, pears and walnuts, regular cracker or biscuit. Try pairing the cheese with drinks such as Pudding wine, Port, Dry sherry, Claret for a great combination.

This celebrated cheese has won many medals at the Nantwich International Cheese Show and a Silver medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards.
