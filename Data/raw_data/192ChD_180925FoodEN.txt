Davidstow Cheddar is a brand of cheese manufactured by Dairy Crest, at Davidstow in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is produced with pasteurized cow's milk supplied by local Cornish farmers and is suitable for vegetarians.

3-Year Reserve Special Vintage Cheddar from Davidstow is typically matured for at least 3 years. During this extended time, the cheddar takes its own course to develop a deep combination of rich & creamy flavours and crumbly, flinty texture. The smooth and creamy taste makes it the perfect cheddar to indulge in on its own with a fine glass of red wine.
