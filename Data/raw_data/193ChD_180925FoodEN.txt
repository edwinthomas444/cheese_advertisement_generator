Davidstow Cheddar is a brand of cheese manufactured by Dairy Crest, at Davidstow in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is produced with pasteurized cow's milk supplied by local Cornish farmers and is suitable for vegetarians.

Extra Mature Cheddar from Davidstow is typically matured for at least 18 months, handing over profound, yet enjoyably sweet, with added layers of intricacy and concentrated spurts of flavour due to the crunchy crystals that the cheese attains with age. It tastes best in a Cornish Rarebit or served alongside a slice of dark, sticky fruit cake.
