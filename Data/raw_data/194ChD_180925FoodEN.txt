Davidstow Cheddar is a brand of cheese manufactured by Dairy Crest, at Davidstow in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is produced with pasteurized cow's milk supplied by local Cornish farmers and is suitable for vegetarians.

Mature Cheddar from Davidstow is typically matured for 14 months, handing over a perfectly balanced, rich, long-lasting, full and ‘nutty’ flavour with a creamy texture and pale glow. It tastes best in a classic English cold meal, watercress soup, ham toasties, or with a cheese biscuit.
