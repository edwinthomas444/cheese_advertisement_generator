Delamere Goats Cheese Logs come from Delamere Dairy's award winning range of pasteurised goats' cheeses. The soft, creamy cheese log is rich in flavour and pre-sliced into six discs for ease of serving. There are three varieties in Delamere Dairy's goat's cheese log: herb log, honey cheese log as well as a natural flavoured log. The different cheeses are very versatile and can be served on crackers or as a salad accompaniment. They work well in cooking in creamy sauces as well as make a brilliant addition to any cheeseboard.

Delamere Goats Log with Honey and Delamere Plain Goats Log have both won Silver at the 2014 World Cheese Awards.
