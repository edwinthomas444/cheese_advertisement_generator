Derby is a traditional British cheese made in Derbyshire, England since the 16th century. Hard to find these days, it is England’s oldest and most famous cheeses made in several varieties including sage and port wine.

Made with cow’s milk, Derby is a semi-hard cheese with a mild flavour and creamy ivory to a rich yellow pate. It is sometimes compared to mild cheddar because of the texture but Derby is more mild with a buttery, creamy flavour and strong melting ability.

Only a few farms in England make Derby cheese the time-honored way. Traditional Derby matured for nine months has an open texture with smooth creamy body and a nutty flavour. It has smooth melting characteristics that pairs with everything from fresh fruits, vegetables to poultry dishes. Couple the cheese with a nice Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc.
