Made by Ben Harris & Robin Congden of the Ticklemore Cheese Co. Devon Blue is a semi-hard blue cheese made using vegetarian rennet and unpasteurised milk from the farm's own herd of Ayreshire cows.

The cheese is matured for six to eight months for the blue mould to develop fully. By the time, it is ready to be sold; Devon Blue is pale, creamy yellow in colour dotted with pockets of blue moulds and veins. The texture is dense and slightly crumbly. It emanates an earthy aroma along with a smooth, rich, complex and buttery taste.

It is best enjoyed on a cheeseboard with a glass of Farmhouse cider or Côtes du Rhône.
