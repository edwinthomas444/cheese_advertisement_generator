Devon Garland is an unpasteurised, firm and vegetarian cow's milk cheese from England. A Caerphilly style cheese, the cheese develops a natural gray crust rind with a firm, smooth touch. The name is derived from the garland of fresh herbs and spring onions added to the cheese just before maturation that gives it a blend of fresh aromas and tastes. After the maturing process of six to eight weeks, the resultant taste is clean, fresh and savory.
