As the name suggests, Dorset White is a soft white mould-ripened cheese, moulded in a log shape. The thick sculpting of the log allows for a creamier, stronger paste just under the rind when ripe, while at the same time preserving a slightly firmer and tangier centre. It is made using unpasteurised cow's milk and traditional animal rennet.
