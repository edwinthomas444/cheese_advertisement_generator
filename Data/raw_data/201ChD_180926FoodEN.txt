Yorkshire Blue is a traditional, vegetarian, blue cheese made from 100% Yorkshire cow’s milk. When launched in 1995, Yorkshire Blue was Shepherds Purse’s first blue and first cow’s milk cheese.

Handcrafted, the cheese is matured over a period of 8 weeks during which the cheese is turned one at a time to ensure uniform blue veining and creaminess.  Upon ripening, the cheese is buttery, sweet and mild in flavour. Extended ageing will give the Yorkshire Blue a more pronounced flavour, but it will always remain mild & creamy. This moist and spreadable cheese can be crumbled or melted into soups, sauces and baking dishes.
