Wellesley is an unpasteurized goat's milk cheese made by Caroline and Will Atkinson outside Stawley near Wellington, Somerset. It is named after the Duke of Wellington. Once the cheese has been salted, it is matured for up to six months. But they are turned regularly during this period to develop a complex, delicious, hard cheese.

Wellesley is light cream to white in colour with a slightly crumbly yet firm texture. Flavours are nutty, sweet with aromas of grass and straw contrasted by a mild acidity.
