Vulscombe is a soft, handmade, fresh, pasteurised goat’s milk cheese produced near Tiverton by Joyce and Graham Townsend. This artisanal cheese is attractively presented and comes in several varieties. Other than plain, Vulscombe offers bold flavours in black pepper, herbs and sun-dried tomatoes. The cheese makers see that the herbs which vary according to the season are freshly picked from their garden. Since no animal rennet is used, the cheese is suitable for vegetarians.

The milk used in the cheese is from a herd of goats in the stunning upper Exe Valley. Rich, creamy and mild in flavour, this cheese looks and tastes amazing.
