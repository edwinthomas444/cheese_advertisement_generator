Cheese has been produced in Lancashire for more than 700 years. There was hardly enough milk for farmers to make the cheese. Without the aid of refrigeration, it was best to turn any leftover milk to curd. Curd from the second day's milk was added to the first and even from the third. This is how Lancashire cheese is still made today from cow's milk.

When creamy Lancashire cheese further matures, the flavour of the cheese intensifies. This cheese can be aged for up to 24 months. This cheese is then classified as Tasty Lancashire cheese. Tasty Lancashire is rich, smooth with a nutty and buttery flavour.

The tasty Lancashire cheese is best had with bread, pickle, or a Real ale beer.
