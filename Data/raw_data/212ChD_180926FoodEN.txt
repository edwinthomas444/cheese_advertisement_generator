Named after the caves in Dorset, Tilly Whim is a semi-soft colourful little cheese with a natural rind and a wonderfully smooth texture. It is ripened for around 6-10 weeks, during which the rind seeps its wonderful distinctive flavour into the cheese underneath. This unpasteurized cow's milk cheese has won many awards, including a silver medal at British Cheese Awards 2013 and gold medal at World Cheese Awards 2014.
