Tregonwell is a Caerphilly-style cheese made using unpasteurized cow's milk and animal rennet. It is matured in the same way like Old Harry enveloped in a natural rind, but it is much crumblier and creamier, with a more subtle taste. 

Tregonwell has always been a respected cheese on a cheese board, but it also tastes delicious when substituted for a Mozzarella on a pizza.
