Tyn Grug is a Welsh organic, vegetarian, hard cheese made from raw cow's milk. It usually has the shape of a cylinder. The recipe for the cheese is very similar to Cheddar and also has a complexity of flavours. At first, there is a hint of young celery leaves, then a rich nuttiness and finally peppery acidity on the finish. Affinage of the cheese takes five months.
