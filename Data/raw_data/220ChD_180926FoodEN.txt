Seator's Orkney is a fresh cow's milk cheese made by Hilda Seator at her Grimbister Farm on the Orkney. The cheese is aged for 4 days, before being sold in the market. 

This young cheese is crumbly with a sharp acid bite. As it matures, it becomes fruity and yeasty with lactic aroma. It is similar to Wensleydale, Caerphilly and Cotherstone – all cheeses that are not very different from Orkney in terms of taste and texture.
