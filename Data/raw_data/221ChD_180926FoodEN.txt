Seriously Strong Cheddar is a Scottish cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk. The ripening usually takes 18 to 24 months. There are six versions of this cheese:

Seriously Strong Cheddar: This full flavoured, extra mature cheddar fills the mouth with intense and lusciously tangy, savory taste. It is perfect for everyday cooking, on sandwiches and with crackers.

Seriously Strong Grated Cheddar: Seriously Strong Cheddar is available pre-grated and shares the same attributes as the block version. Ideal to sprinkle on finished, baked dishes.

Seriously Strong Spreadable: The full flavoured, tangy taste is available in spreadable form, making it the ultimate extra mature cheddar to spread on crusty bread, crackers, toast or just use as a dip.

Seriously Strong Spreadable Chilli: Flavoured with chilli for that extra kick, this bold spreadable cheese tastes best with crusty bread, crackers, toast or just as a dip.

Seriously Strong Spreadable Smokey: Treated by smoke curing, Seriously Strong Spreadable Smokey offers a well rounded, balanced taste. As with other spreadable, it tastes well with toast or crackers.

Seriously Strong Vintage Cheddar: Matured for a minimum of 18 months, the full bodied – bold flavour with sharp caramel notes highlights the taste of baked dishes. But it should be best enjoyed on its own.
