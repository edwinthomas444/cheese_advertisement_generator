Ford Farm's Wookey Hole Farmhouse Cheddar is cave-aged Cheddar matured in the Wookey Hole Caves in Somerset, England. The cheese is first created at their Dorset Cheese Farm using pasteurised cow’s milk and vegetarian rennet. Then, they wrap it in cloth and take it to the heart of the caves where the cheese is matured at a constant temperature for up to six months.

This award-winning authentic handmade cheese is protected by PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), whereby it can be manufactured only in the counties of Dorset, Somerset, and Devon & Cornwall. Wookey Hole Farmhouse Cheddar is crumbly with earthy undertones and a distinctly nutty, tangy flavour.
