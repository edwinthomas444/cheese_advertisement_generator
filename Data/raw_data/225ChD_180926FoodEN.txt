Sharpham Rustic is a semi-hard, unpasteurized cheese made with Jersey cow's milk. It will develop a lovely fresh, lemony, creamy flavour when young, which evolves into a distinctive nutty matured taste as the cheese matures. This handmade cheese is aged for a month and has an approximately one month shelf life (which also depends on the size of the cheese).

The cheese has won many awards, including gold at Global Cheese Awards 2014, gold at British Cheese Awards 2013 and bronze at Taste of the West Awards 2014.
