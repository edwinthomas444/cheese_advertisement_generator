Sharpham Chive & Garlic Rustic is a semi-hard, unpasteurized cheese made with Jersey cow's milk. After around a month, it will develop an intense savoury flavour balancing the creaminess of the cheese. The cheese is a slight variation of the Sharpham Rustic with chives and garlic added before the cheese is moulded. It has an approximately one month shelf life (which also depends on the size of the cheese).

This cheese has won many awards, including gold at Global Cheese Awards 2013, bronze at British Cheese Awards 2014 and silver at Taste of the West Awards 2014.
