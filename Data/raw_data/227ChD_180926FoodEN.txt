Stoney Cross is a truckle of mould ripened cheese, very similar to a French Tomme De Savoie. It is creamy in texture with sweet flavours and a distinctly earthy finish. The cheese is named after an old World War II airfield 2 miles to the South of the Lyburn farm.

The subtle flavours and smooth texture of this cheese have brought Lyburn farm many awards, including a Bronze at the British cheese awards, Silver at Nantwich and One Star Gold at the Great Taste.
