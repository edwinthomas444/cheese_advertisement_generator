The Wyfe of Bath is a farmhouse style cheese made from organic pasteurized cows milk. It is a semi-hard cheese, the recipe for which is loosely based on a Dutch gouda, however, the Wyfe of Bath is pressed gently so it retains more moisture and has a wonderful buttery finish redolent of the fields of the farm.
