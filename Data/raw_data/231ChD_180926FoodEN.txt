Stichelton is an English blue cheese made by Joe Schneider using organic, unpasteurised Friesian-Holstein cow's milk on his Collingthwaite Farm in Nottinghamshire. It is made to a traditional Blue Stilton recipe, except that it uses raw milk and rennet from calves' stomachs. The cheesemakers could not legally use the name 'Stilton' since it is granted the status of PDO by the European Commission. Therefore, they decided to use an early form of the name of the Stilton village mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book (Stichiltone/Sticiltone).

The flavours of the creamy white cheese are nutty and reminiscent of apples with underlying toasty notes. The delicate veins of blue-green mould beneath the rusty-coloured, orange-brown rind behold a spicy, savoury element and a long-lasting caramel-like sweetness.
