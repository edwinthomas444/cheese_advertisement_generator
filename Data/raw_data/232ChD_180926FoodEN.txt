Sharpham is an unpasteurised Coulommiers type English Cheese made at the Sharpham Dairy in South Devon. Handmade at the creamery, it has stayed true to its 1980 recipe, which includes the use of vegetarian rennet and fresh Jersey cow milk.

The inimitable buttery flavour of this mould ripened cheese is complemented by the soft, creamy texture. Meltingly soft and gooey, Sharpham is highly recommened with bread or biscuits.

Sharpham has won many awards for its flavour and texture including Super Gold - World Cheese Awards 2010 and Best Soft White - British Cheese Awards.
