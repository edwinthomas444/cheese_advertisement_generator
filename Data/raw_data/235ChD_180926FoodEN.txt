Double Worcester is a tasty and smaller variation of Double Gloucester made by Colin and Alyson Anstey on their Broomhill Farm in Worcester. The cheese usually has a cylinder shape with a hard, natural rind. By about 5-7 months of affinage, the cheese starts developing a firm, flaky texture and a straw yellow interior with a flavour of citrusy tang. It is made with pasteurised cow’s milk, vegetarian rennet and coloured traditionally with annatto. The cheese won a silver medal at the British Cheese Awards in 2001.
