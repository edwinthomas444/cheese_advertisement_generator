Duddleswell is a high fat sheep’s cheese made at the High Weald Dairy in West Sussex, United Kingdom. It is a richly flavoured cheese with a slightly acidic taste underlined by sweet and buttery notes. A tasting of the cheese reveals a sweet, caramel tang accentuated by hints of Brazilian nuts and fresh hay. The natural rind of the cheese formed during maturation, is edible.

The cheese is matured for 5 months during which it is turned daily in temperature controlled conditions. To make the smoked version of Duddleswell, the whole cheeses are lightly smoked over oak shavings for around 12 to 36 hours, depending on weather conditions. Duddleswell has received many awards including Gold at International Cheese Awards 2010 and 2011 and Bronze at British Cheese Awards 2010. All of the cheeses made at the dairy are suitable for vegetarians since only vegetable rennet is used during processing. Duddleswell pairs well with Merlot. This hard cheese highlights the flavour of pasta dishes and salads.
