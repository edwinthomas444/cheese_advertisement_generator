Dunlop is a traditional hard Scottish cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk of Ayrshire breed. Named after the village of Dunlop in East Ayrshire, Scotland, the cheese is made using vegetarian rennet, which makes it suitable for vegetarians. A sweet milk cheese, its popularity drizzled in the Second World War but now it is appreciated for its pairings with whisky, recipes or eating on its own.

Developed by Barbara Gilmour in the 1700s, the cheese shares similarities with Cheddar cheese but is softer. When young, the cheese develops a nutty flavour and smooth, close texture. As it matures, the texture becomes firm and builds up sharp flavours. It is matured for a minimum of 6 months.

A variant of Dunlop is smoked over beechwood to add an extra layer of flavour.
