Dunsyre Blue is a mould ripened, handmade cheese from H.J. Errington farms in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Made using unpasteurised milk of Ayrshire cows, it is named after a small village near Lanark in the Clyde Valley.

An aged Dunsyre Blue has chunky blue-green moulds intercepting the smooth, creamy coloured interior. When fully developed the cheese imparts a complex flavour that is slightly rich, a little salty, sweet, sharp and spicy. Each flavour has a character of its own and leaves behind a strikingly long aftertaste. The farm has been making this traditional cheese for the last 25 years. Dunsyre Blue is great with either Whisky or a Rhone wine.
