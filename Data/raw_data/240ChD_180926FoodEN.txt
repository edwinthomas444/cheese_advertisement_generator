Wensleydale is an historic fresh, mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.

Extra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.
