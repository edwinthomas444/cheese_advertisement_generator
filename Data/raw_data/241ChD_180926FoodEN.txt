Finn is an unpasteurised, soft-white cheese produced by Charlie Westhead of Neal's Yard Creamery. It is the only triple cream cheese made in England. Firm with a rich, double creamy texture, the mild cheese is fresh and lactic when young taking on a mushroomy and nutty taste as it matures. Like other French cream cheeses, 10% additional cream is added before the actual process of cheesemaking starts. Ripened for 2-3 weeks, it is sold as a 200 gms cheese cylinder.
