Made by Kevin and Alison Blunt of the Golden Cross Cheese at their Greenacres Farm, Flower Marie is a delicate little artisanal cheese made from sheep’s milk. The name Flower Marie is inspired from the Corsican sheep cheese, 'Fleur de Maquis'.  Makers of the cheese have formulated the produce suitable for vegetarians by using vegetable rennet to coagulate the milk.

Soft in texture, the milk is sourced from a herd of Friesland-Dorset sheep. It is matured for a minimum of three weeks at the end of which the square molds develop a bloomy, pinkish rind. The paste is ivory white in colour, resembling a whipped ice cream. This aromatic cheese is mushroomy, sweet and slightly citrusy in flavour. As it ages, Flower Marie develops more intense flavours but also softens down.
