Francis, named for the late James Aldridge is a joint collaboration between James McCall and Lyburn Farm. With silky-smooth, buttery paste and well distributed eyes; it actually is a Stoney Cross but now washed in a traditional French culture to develop a very pink and sticky rind.

The young cheeses are matured for 8-10 weeks at James McCall’s specialised temperature and humidity controlled maturing rooms in Child Okeford. The result is a supple, richly-flavoured cheese with a wonderfully pungent aroma and softness around the rind.

Francis has achieved Silver at the World Cheese Awards in 2011, Gold at the 2012 British Cheese Awards and the Best Semi Soft, at the British Cheese Awards 2013.
