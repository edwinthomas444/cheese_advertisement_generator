Golden Cross is a vegetarian, soft, log-shaped cheese made by Kevin and Alison Blunt at their farm at Whitesmith, East Sussex. The name of the cheese has been inspired from a cross on the roof of a local village pub. It has a dense, silky texture, which makes it excellent for grilling. The cheese ranges in flavour from subtle, floral, and grassy to more complex and intense as it becomes denser, creamier and full-flavoured with maturity. Each log is lightly charcoaled before the bloomy white rind develops. Try the cheese with sparkling wine like Chapel Down Brut.
