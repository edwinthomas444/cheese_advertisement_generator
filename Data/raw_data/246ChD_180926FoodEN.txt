Gorwydd Caerphilly is an artisanal Welsh cheese made by Todd, Maugan and Kim Trethowan at their Gorwydd Farm at Llanddewi Brefi, Ceredigion. Made with unpasteurised cow's milk and traditional animal rennet, Gorwydd Caerphilly is matured for three months to give a wonderfully oozy, mushroomy cream layer around a springy, citric, lactic core.

This excellent traditional cheese has won a number of prestigious cheese awards. It pairs well with Viogner and Chardonnay.
