Gospel Green is a hard cheese made from cow’s milk produced by James and Cathy Lane. Though the cheese belongs to cheddar family, yet it is slightly soft and less dense with a crumbly texture and cloth-wrapped rind. To ripen completely, it takes 2-3 months.

Often used for grating and grilling, it aromatizes the kitchen with fruity smell of apple. Great for vegetarians, it contains 48% fat and pairs well with Merlot.
