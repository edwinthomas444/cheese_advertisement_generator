Hafod is traditional, hard clothbound Cheddar handmade by Sam and Rachel Holden at Wales's longest certified organic dairy farm, Bwlchwernen Fawr. It is made only from raw Ayrshire milk, as it is more robust and makes the cheese buttery-rich with a good, firm texture.

Hafod (pronounced Havod) is characterized by a smooth, quite close-knit texture and golden yellow colour. It tastes buttery, rich and nutty with a slightly tangy finish. The cheese is matured for 10 to 18 months during which it develops a moldy rind. Suitable for pregnant women.
