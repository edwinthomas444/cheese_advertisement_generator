Harbourne Blue is a semi-soft cheese made from pasteurised goat’s milk. For the first time, it was made by Robin Congdon and later on, it is produced by Ticklemore Cheese in Devon. For maturation, the cheese takes around 10 weeks and forms a crumbly, dense and melting texture.

As it is made by hands, therefore, the cheese retains its sweet, spicy taste and aromatic smell. It is suitable for vegetarians and contains 48% fat. Being a milder cheese, it can be served with wines like Sauternes, Port and Bordeaux.
