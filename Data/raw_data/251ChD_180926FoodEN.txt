Hereford Hop is a British cheese, handmade by Charles Martell, maker of the famous Stinking Bishop. He invented the cheese in 1990 on the Hunts Court Farm which is a few miles away from the Herefordshire border.

The hard cheese is made using natural rennet and full fat pasteurised cows’ milk. Coated with toasted hops, Hereford Hop produces citrusy, buttery and sharp flavours together with a slight bitterness of the hops. A version made with raw milk is also available.
