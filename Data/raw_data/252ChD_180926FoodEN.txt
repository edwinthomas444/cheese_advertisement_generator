Huntsman is a concoction of two classic cheeses produced in the English countryside. Double Gloucester is a firm, mellow and tangy cheese made only from the milk of Gloucester cows in southwestern England while Stilton Blue cheese is a blue-veined, strong, smooth and creamy cheese with a distinctive flavour profile. Though the combination seems unusual, the English cheesemakers have made it possible by presenting a layered representation of the two cheeses. Stilton is sandwiched between layers of satiny Double Gloucester, resulting in a powerful flavour combination of the two.

It is a difficult cheese to cook with, but visually stunning on a cheese platter. Each cheese could have its own wine pairing, but together they go well with ales and beers.
