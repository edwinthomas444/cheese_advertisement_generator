Innes Button is an artisanal unpasteurised goat’s cheese handcrafted at Highfields Farm Dairy using time-honored traditional craft methods. Prepared by Stella Bennett and her son Joe on a small, independent farm, Innes Button has received many awards at the British Cheese Awards in 1994 and 2002. Hugh Lillingston, who formerly owned the dairy, is said to have introduced the cheese.

Made using vegetable rennet, Innes Button is a small, light textured, round cheese measuring around 4 cms in diameter. It imparts a fresh, lemony and tangy flavour to salads and grilled dishes. A larger version of the Innes Button weighing 100 gms is available as Innes Clifton. Innes Button is sold in its natural form or can be bought coated with Pink Pepper, Salted Ash and Rosemary toppings. Being a fresh cheese sold at just 5 days old, it has to be consumed within a week. The cheese pairs perfectly with Sancerre.
