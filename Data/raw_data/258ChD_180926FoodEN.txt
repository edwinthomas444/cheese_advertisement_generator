Lairobell is an unpasteurised goat’s milk cheese produced by Hattie and Jock Bell of Scotland at their East Lairo, Shapinsay farm on Orkney Isles. Made usually only from spring to autumn, this vegetarian hard cheese takes two to eight weeks of curing and maturation to ensure authentic, deep flavours and correct consistency. Lairobell cheese, sold in cylindrical shapes, has a sweet, almond like flavour and almost mild undertones of herbs.

Creamy, crumbly and tasty, it makes for an excellent salad dressing and a great addition to soups.
