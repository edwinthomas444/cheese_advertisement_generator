Lord of the Hundreds is a raw sheep's milk produced by Cliff and Julie Dyball of The Traditional Cheese Dairy in East Sussex, United Kingdom. It takes its name from the Saxon times when tax collectors used to work on behalf of the Lords.

This hard cheese has a square shape and open texture because it is not pressed before being ladled into baskets. The aging process takes six to eight months during which the cheeses are rubbed and turned every other day to create a light grey rind. Underneath is a golden yellow paste that deepens as it gets closer to the rind. The texture is dry and a bit grainy with flavour of roasted hazelnuts and salty caramel, along with fresh grassy notes. Lord of the Hundred's sweet and savory flavour pairs very good with medium-bodied Pinot-Noir or Cream Ale as a beer selection. This cheese can be used as a substitute to Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This celebrated cheese has won many awards including Gold medal (in 2011) and silver medal  (in 2012) at The British Cheese Awards and bronze medal at the World Cheese Awards 2014.
