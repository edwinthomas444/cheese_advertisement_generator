Lyburn Garlic and Nettle starts out as Lyburn Gold, but is not matured for so long. It is infused with hints of garlic and onion along with chives, parsley, paprika, ginger, horseradish and celery. The nettle gives the cheese a bit of colour while the garlic balances the flavour without overpowering it. Lyburn Garlic and Nettle won the farm Silver at the British Cheese Awards 2010 and again a Bronze in 2014.
