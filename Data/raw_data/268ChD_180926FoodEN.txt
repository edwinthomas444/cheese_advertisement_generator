Lyburn Lightly Oak Smoked starts out as Lyburn Gold, still a washed rind curd but with not so prominent eyes and a smoother texture and light, delicate flavour. This flavoured variant is lightly smoked at Dorset Smokery for a couple of days to make a beautifully soft tasting cheese. The flavours of Lyburn Lightly Oak Smoked have won the farm a silver at the 2014 British Cheese Awards.
