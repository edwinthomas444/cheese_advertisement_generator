Malvern is an English cheese that is produced in the Severn Valley region of the United Kingdom. It is made from unpasteurised sheep's milk and is a vegetarian cheese. Malvern cheese is semi-hard in texture with an ivory to cream colour pate. Firm and dry, yet dense and creamy in the mouth, it has a sweet, butterscotch taste infused with a hint of thyme. The aging lasts for 2 to 4 months and the fat content is 50%. At the 1997 British Cheese Awards it won a silver medal. It is a good cheese for grilling or grating on salads, pasta and snacking.
