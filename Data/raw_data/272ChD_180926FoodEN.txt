Marble Cheddar is a variant of typical English Cheddar produced by blending white and orange cheddars. Similar to traditional cheddar it has a very rich taste and smooth, buttery texture. The cheese can be enjoyed in quiches, omelets or melted over baked dishes and vegetables. Add it to pastries for a melt-in-the-mouth creamy flavour.
