Marble cheeses are a combination of Colby and Monterey Jack or white and orange Cheddar curds. These cheeses vary in textures and can be either creamy or firm.

Colby Jack: Colby Jack or Cojack is a classic American combination of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese. The taste of Colby Jack varies from mild and smooth, to lightly sweet, to sharp and tangy. Due to its good melting capabilities this cheese is very popular with Mexican dishes.
