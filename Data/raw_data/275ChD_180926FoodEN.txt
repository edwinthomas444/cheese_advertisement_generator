May Hill Green is a full fat vegetarian award winning soft cheese, made by Charles Martell & Son at Dymock in Gloucestershire.

It's made with a mixture of pasteurised milk of rare-breed Gloucester and Friesian cattle in a manner similar to Stinking Bishop, except that the rind is not washed. Instead the rind is topped by chopped nettles and coiled by a Beechwood lath to give the cheese a distinct character.

The pate is semi-soft with a soft and runny texture and a peppery finish. Flavour is lactic with and fairly strong aroma. It is great cheese to serve on a cheeseboard or spread on flavoured bread.
