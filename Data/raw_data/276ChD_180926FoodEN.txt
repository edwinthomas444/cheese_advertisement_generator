Montgomery's Cheddar is one of the few truly traditional, handmade, unpasteurised types of Cheddar produced by James Montgomery in Somerset, England. The farm uses milk only from Montgomery's own herd of 200 Friesian cows. The cheese is made available in variety of flavour, ageing periods and sizes. Most cheeses are matured for 12 months in a muslin cloth on wooden shelves, while some like Montgomery's Extra Mature Cheddar are aged for 18 months to deliver that special texture and flavour. 

Montgomery's Mature Cheddar reveals deep, rich, nutty flavours while the Extra Mature variety brings a nuttier, spicier and peppery flavour to the palate. As with ageing, the texture is also a little drier than Mature. Montgomery's Smoked Cheddar is oak-smoked for six hours to give an intense smokey flavour and aroma, which complements the nutty flavour of the cheese. 

The Cheddar can be eaten cooked, grated or eaten on its own. However, it makes its mark when added to the cheeseboard.
