Ogleshield is a British cheese made using beautifully rich raw Jersey milk by Jamie Montgomery & Wayne Mitchell of Montgomery cheese making family. The cheese is washed in special brine every three days to attain a slightly pungent sticky rind, which softens the cheese paste and significantly intensifies its flavour. This cross between the Montgomery's Cheddar and a Tomme is excellent when it comes to cooking as it melts brilliantly.

This celebrated cheese has won silver award at the 2014 World Cheese Awards.
