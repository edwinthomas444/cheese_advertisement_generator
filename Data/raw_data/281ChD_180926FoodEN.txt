Old Ford is a semi-hard, raw goat's milk cheese made by Mary Holbrook of Britain's Sleight Farm. During the summer, when the temperatures are warmer, Old Ford ripens quickly in three months while in the autumn it can take up to eight months for the cheese to reveal its best characteristics. Cheeses made in the autumn, are often quite dense and intense by the time they are sold.

Old Ford has a natural brown rind with a delicious crumble and savoury snowy white interior. It is a tomme with tones of salt, flowers and a little bit of barnyard.
