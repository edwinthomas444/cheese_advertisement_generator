Old Harry is traditional Cheddar named after the Old Harry Rocks off the Dorset coast. It is matured for three months, during which it develops a wonderfully complex flavour and smooth texture beneath the natural rind. It is made using unpasteurized cow's milk and traditional rennet. Remember to trim off the rind before eating.
