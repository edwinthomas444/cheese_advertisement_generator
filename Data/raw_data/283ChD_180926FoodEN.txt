Old Winchester, popularly known as Old Smales is a matured version of Winchester. It is a much dryer and harder cheese with a characteristic nutty flavour. Since Old Winchester is made with vegetarian rennet, the cheese is used as a common replacement for hard Italian table cheeses. The wheels are sold at 18 months age when it is full flavoured with an underlying sweetness, and a crunchy finish.

Old Winchester has won many awards, including Best Modern British Cheese in 2006, Reserve Champion Cheese at the Bath and West in 2007. Each year, it has been consistently winning a one, two or a three star at the Great Tate Awards.
