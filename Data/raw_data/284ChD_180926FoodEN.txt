Orkney Extra Mature Cheddar is a hard cow’s milk cheese made from milk produced only by farmers from the Orkney Isles. Depending on varieties, it can take 10 - 18 months for maturation. With smooth and firm texture, it has sharp, nutty flavour plus strong aroma. An excellent addition to cooking as it releases less oil when melted and it appears great on sandwiches.
