Orkney Island Cheddar is cow's milk Cheddar crafted only from the milk sourced from the Orkney Isles. Flavour-wise, it is characterised by moderate levels of sharp acid notes, rounded taste and savoury, nutty notes. It always has a clean aroma with a firm but malleable texture which is smooth and closed. All Cheddar cheeses are matured for 6 to 18 months, providing a variety of flavour profiles.

Medium Cheddar aged for 6-12 months is creamy and mellow with slightly savoury flavour. The paste is bright even colour with a smooth and malleable texture. The cheese will be white or coloured, wherein the bright colour comes from a vegetable colour pigment added after pasteurization.

Cheddar has always been a favourite on cheeseboards but also tastes delicious on sandwiches.
