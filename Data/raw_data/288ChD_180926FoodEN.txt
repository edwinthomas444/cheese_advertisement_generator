Pant-Ys-Gawn, also spelt as Pantysgawn or Pant-Ysgawn, is a Welsh goat’s milk cheese first made by Tony Craske on his farm "Pant-Ysgawn" near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales. Later he expanded his business, renaming the company Abergavenny Fine Foods Ltd.

Pant-Ys-Gawn is made from pasteurised goat’s milk sourced from Brecon Beacons National Park. It is a soft, creamy and salty cheese with a hint of sourness which is sometimes associated with the acidity of lemon. Sold in logs of 1 kg or 150 grams, this rindless cheese can be bought rolled either in black peppercorns or in mixed herbs. It is a table cheese suitable for snacks, grilling, spreading or in salads.
