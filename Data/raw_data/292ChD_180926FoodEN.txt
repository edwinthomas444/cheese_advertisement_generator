Perroche is an English unpasteurized goat's milk cheese made by Charlie Westhead and Haydn Roberts at Neal Yard's Creamery. It is named after Beatrice Garroche who along with Perry James made this cheese in the early 1980s. It is a soft, creamy, fresh cheese, curdled using traditional animal rennet. When Perroche is ready for eating, it is moist and fluffy but has a structured texture (quite unlike for a fresh cheese). The flavours are balanced with light, brightly lemony goaty essence. It comes plain or rolled in tarragon, dill or rosemary.
