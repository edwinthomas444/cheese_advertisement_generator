Y Fenni, a Welsh Cheddar cheese made with Welsh brown ale and wholegrain mustard seeds, when coated with bright red wax is known as Red Dragon. It takes its name from the dragon symbol on the Welsh flag. 

The moist yet firm Red Dragon is aged for 3 months and made from pasteurised cow's milk and vegetable rennet. The mustard seeds not only give it a unique texture but also an amazing buttery and spicy flavour. Along with the subtle sharpness of mustard seeds, the flavour of Red Dragon is also reminiscent of the mild, sharp taste of the Welsh ale and traditional cheddar. Some say, the taste of the cheese is very similar to sharp cheddar. 

Serve Red Dragon with dark ale or try a strong red wine. It is an excellent table cheese that melts well on a sandwich.
