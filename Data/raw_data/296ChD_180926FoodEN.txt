Red Windsor is a pinkish white marbled English cheddar laced with Bordeaux wine or a mix of port wine and brandy. The patterned cheese presents the best of both worlds by combining a delightful and delicious mix of flavours. It has the fruitiness of port and brandy and creamy cheesiness of semi-hard cheddar.

Long Clawson dairy produces this cheese from pasteurised cow's milk and vegetarian rennet. A visually stunning cheese, Red Windsor is a great addition to any cheeseboard and pairs very well with port, grapes and green salad.
