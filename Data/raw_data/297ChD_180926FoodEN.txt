Tesco's Scotch Bonnet Cheddar is said to be the hottest cheese ever sold in Britain. It combines traditional Cheddar with fiery Scotch Bonnet chilli peppers that are 50 times hotter than a jalapeno. The Cheddar cheese has a heat intensity of 100,000 to 350,000 Scoville units in contrast to a jalapeno, which has a rating of just 2,500 to 8,000. The cheese is palatable only to those who can cope with extreme heat. In fact, Tesco has labelled the cheese with a warning saying the chilli Cheddar is not for faint hearted.

The cheese is mature, rich in flavour with creaminess and softness that is unusual for Cheddar. It leaves the fiery feeling of the chillies in the mouth and throat long after you have eaten it.

Scotch Bonnet Cheddar is sold across all Tesco stores in the country.
