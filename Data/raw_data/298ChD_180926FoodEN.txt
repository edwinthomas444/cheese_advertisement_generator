Sharpham Elmhirst is a mould-ripened, triple cream cheese made with unpasteurized Jersey cow's milk, in the style of 'Vignotte'. The name Elmhirst is the maiden name of entrepreneur Ruth Ash, who was actively involved in setting up cheese production at Sharpham in the early 1980s.

This is a soft, smooth cheese with a white and bloomy rind draping a light and silky textured white paste. When young, Sharpham Elmhirst has a delicate flavour, which evolves into a luxuriously rich, creamy and full bodied flavour as the cheese matures. It is one of only two triple cream cheeses made in the UK.

The cheese has won many awards, including gold at Taste of the West Awards and bronze at British Cheese Awards.
