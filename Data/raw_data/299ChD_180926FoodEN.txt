Sharpham Savour is an unpressed, semi-hard cheese made with unpasteurized mix of Jersey cow and goat milk. It was first made to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the South Devon AONB.

It is a creamy, washed curd cheese with a pliant, close texture. Available in 1.3kg rounds, its mellow and sweet flavour pairs beautifully with fruit pastes.

The cheese has won many awards, including silver at Taste of the West 2014 and bronze at British Cheese Awards 2013 & 2014.
