Charlie Westhead makes a range of cheeses at his dairy in Herefordshire. Ragstone was one of Charlie’s early creations, made at a dairy in Sevenoaks, where he was originally based. Charlie named the cheese after Ragstone Ridge, which ran close by. 
This goats’ cheese is made with a twist on the traditional French Sainte Maure, by adding in a white mould.
The curd is set overnight, before being hand-ladled into log-shaped moulds. After two to three weeks, the cheese has developed its coat, a creamy texture and a lemony flavour.
Recently, Charlie has adapted the recipe (and his use of ‘starter’ bacteria) to produce a smoother, creamier cheese, that is less acidic and more complex.
