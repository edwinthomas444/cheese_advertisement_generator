Joe Schneider revived the tradition of making this famous blue cheese in 2006. Unpasteurised milk, a long slow acidification, and hand ladling make Stichelton a revelation. It is creamy, rich and nutty, with a gentle blue tang.
In October 2006, Joe Schneider set up to revive the tradition of making unpasteurised Stilton. Unable to call his cheese 'Stilton', he set upon the name Stichelton (the old name for the town of Stilton). Unpasteurised milk, slow acidification and hand-ladling make this cheese a revelation.

Every piece freshly cut & wrapped 

We unashamedly source, care for and sell the best cheese, because that is what we believe in. Every day of dispatch one of our trained cheesemongers cuts every piece fresh, by hand, and wraps it in our waxed paper. We do this because it is most respectful way to treat this precious food.
