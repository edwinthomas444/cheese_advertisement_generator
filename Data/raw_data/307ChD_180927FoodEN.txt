Our The Fine Cheese Co. English Farmhouse Cheddar cheese range is made in conjunction with a West Country farmer to our own specifications and we are proud of the results.

We wanted a Cheddar with lots of flavour, so we have specified a taste profile that is powerful and tangy, with a creamy finish.

This cheese is made using traditional Cheddar methods before being matured for at least 14 months.  After grading and to ensure it has developed the necessary full, sweet flavour and tangy bite, it is formed then dipped into burgundy wax.

We don't think that you will find a better tasting small Cheddar.
