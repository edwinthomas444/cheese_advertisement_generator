Tunworth has the thinnest possible rind, an undulating surface, and a profoundly fruity tang - enough to convince a Frenchman that this was made on his terroir.

The cheese's maker, Stacey Hedges, started making cheese in 2004. After visiting traditional Camembert producers in Normandy, she began on her recipe to produce this cheese. Using local milk, Tunworth was created.

Stacey uses a very traditional recipe that not very many Camembert makers use as it is so difficult to make. The cheese-making process includes a slow overnight acidification. The curds are hand-ladled into moulds and very gently handled.

In 2006, Tunworth, the closest cheese this country has produced to a Camembert, became Supreme Champion at the British Cheese Awards; a feat that was repeated in 2013.
