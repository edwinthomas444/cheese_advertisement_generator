Winslade is a rich and silky-smooth cheese. Its gooey paste is encased by a band of spruce that imparts a delicate, woody aroma. The flavour is full, fruity and complex but never over-powering with a quiet, floral earthiness. It is a decidedly refined cheese, made in Hampshire, England with finesse.
