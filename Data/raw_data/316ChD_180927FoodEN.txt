Made with organic milk from the cheesemaker's, family-run farm, Bath Blue cheese is produced by following a traditional Stilton recipe. It is creamy, with even blueing throughout.

Nestled in the Mendip Hills, Park Farm has been home to the Padfield Family for four generations. Cheese was made here as far back as 1914. All the cheeses are made on the farm using milk from the family’s organic Friesian herd.

Bath Blue follows a traditional Stilton recipe but unlike the majority of Stiltons, with a few notable exceptions, each stage is done entirely by hand. They are made in very small batches using a vat which is around half the size of even the smallest Stilton maker and then in individual buckets. By making to such a small scale, the cheese-maker has greater control over the alchemy of cheese-making and can maintain the highest quality.

Graham and Hugh were delighted when Bath Blue was voted Supreme Champion at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. More recently it won gold in the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards too.

 
Every piece freshly cut & wrapped 

We unashamedly source, care for and sell the best cheese, because that is what we believe in. Every day of dispatch one of our trained cheesemongers cuts every piece fresh, by hand, and wraps it in our waxed paper. We do this because it is most respectful way to treat this precious food.
