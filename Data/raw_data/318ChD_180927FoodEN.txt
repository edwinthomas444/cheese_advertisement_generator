Graceburn is a superbly soft and rich cheese, based on a Persian Feta recipe, and made by David Holton and Tim Jarvis at Blackwoods Cheese Company in Kent.

David and Tim have based their dairy on Common Work Organic Farm, which has a herd of Friesian Holsteins, cross-bred with Swedish Red and Montbeliarde cattle.This milk provides the perfect balance of butter fat and proteins, which makes it particularly suitable for creating this super-creamy, fresh cheese.

Initially, David and Tim soak the fresh cheeses in brine. Unlike traditional Feta, which is preserved in larger blocks, Graceburn is broken by hand into smaller pieces, and steeped in a blend of extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil, infused with thyme, garlic, bay and pepper.

The rich and creamy cows’ milk makes Graceburn softer and more melt-in-the-mouth than traditional Feta.
