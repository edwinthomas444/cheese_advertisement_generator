This authentic, PDO, West Country Farmhouse Cheddar is made in Dorset, using the traditional method of stacking the curds by hand. Once it has been matured until it has reached the desired creamy consistency and tangy bite, the cheese is then sent to a local smokehouse to be gently smoked over oak chippings, until it has taken on its characteristic delicately smoky aromas and flavour. The smoke is delicately judged, to allow the mature, farmhouse character of the Cheddar to shine through.
