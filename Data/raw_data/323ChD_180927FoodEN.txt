The Fine Cheese Co. Ewes' Milk Cheddar
Our new, ewes' milk Cheddar is made in Dorset using traditional Cheddar methods. The delicate ewes' milk gives an aromatic flavour, reminiscent of the lush pastures of the South West. The flavour is fresh and bright, yet balanced with a long, complex finish.

Hand-made in Dorset, using the same traditional methods as our English Farmhouse Cheddar, but with ewes’ milk. The cheese is matured for around six months, to develop a mellow and slightly sweet flavour. Less robust in character than classic Cheddar, this cheese reflects the more delicate nature of ewes’ milk.
