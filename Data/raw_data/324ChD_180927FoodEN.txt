A truly interesting new cheese, made by Marcus Fergusson at Feltham’s Farm in Somerset. Marcus, who has a history of working in the music industry, left his job in London in December 2015, and decided it was time to make a living on his 22 acre smallholding in Somerset. He began making cheese in the Spring of 2016, and began selling it to the public in February 2017.
Marcus sources organic milk from a local farm, and then transforms it into this wild cheese, in extremely small batches. The rind is washed in ale from Milk Street Brewery in Frome, and blue cultures are added to enhance the flavour, even if the cheese remains vein-less when ripe. It is a bold and assertive little cheese, but the pungency is balanced by a pleasant sweetness, a slightly more floral taste than other washed rind cheeses, and a very subtle blue undertone.
