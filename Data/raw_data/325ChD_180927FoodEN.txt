Waterloo cheese is soft, rich and buttery like a hollandaise sauce, but with a lactic finish emanating from its centre.

It is made by Anne and Andy Wigmore in Berkshire and was originally made with Guernsey milk from the Duke of Wellington’s estate. Stratfield Saye has been home to the Dukes of Wellington since it was acquired by the very first Duke after the battle of Waterloo in 1817.

The milk now comes from a single herd of Guernsey cows near Henley. Anne and Andy wash the curds for this cheese to lower the acidity, which gives it a gentle, sweet flavour.

You may purchase Waterloo as a whole cheese in 400g or 800g weights, or as a 200g cut.
