This cheese is out of season while the goats are resting before kidding. Why not try Dorstone?

Just south of Bath is the village of Timsbury, and Mary Holbrook’s Sleight Farm. Mary Holbrook has been making cheese there since the 1970s. Mary is a pioneer of the British artisan cheese industry, and she has won a number of awards. Now Mary also provides inspiration and guidance to younger cheese-makers.
Tymsboro' was one of her early cheeses. It is based on a Valençay recipe that Mary found when visiting Tours in France. Immediately after milking her goats (mainly Saanens), Mary uses left-over whey to start the long process of setting the curd. This is a traditional method that makes use of the natural bacteria that are unique to the farm. It is a hard process to manage, and is now rarely seen, even in France. 
After 24 hours the curd has set, and the cheese is hand-ladled into moulds, to drain gently. The pyramids are hand-salted, and, after three days, they are ready to be ‘ashed’. The ashed pyramids are then matured for two to three weeks, to allow the growth of a natural rind. During this time, the texture changes from a ‘mousse’ to an ‘ice-cream’, and the flavour becomes smoother, rounder and fuller.
