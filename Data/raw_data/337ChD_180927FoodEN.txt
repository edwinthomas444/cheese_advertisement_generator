Wigmore cheese is complex and fruity, and rich and unctuous, with a great delicacy of taste and texture. It's the sister cheese to Waterloo. They are both washed curd cheeses, which means that an amount of whey is replaced with water during the make, so leading to  a gentle, delicate flavour and a smooth texture. Do not imagine this creates a bland cheese though. 

Anne Wigmore began making cheese in the experimental dairy at the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD) in 1984, having worked there previously for a number of  years as a microbiologist. Soon afterwards, she decided to set up on her own, and, in 1986, Village Maid Dairy was born in a converted building at the end of her garden. Anne’s knowledge of cheese-making is highly technical, but she has a great feel for the cheese too.

You may purchase Wigmore as a whole cheese in 400g or 800g weights, or as a 200g cut.
