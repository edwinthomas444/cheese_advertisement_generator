A cheese based on an idea from the cows themselves, who have a taste for the wild garlic where they graze. The cheese-makers add more wild garlic and chives to the milk, to help nature along. The result is a rich Jersey-milk cheese, with a delicious 'oniony' tang.

Every piece freshly cut & wrapped 

We unashamedly source, care for and sell the best cheese, because that is what we believe in. Every day of dispatch one of our trained cheesemongers cuts every piece fresh, by hand, and wraps it in our waxed paper. We do this because it is most respectful way to treat this precious food.
