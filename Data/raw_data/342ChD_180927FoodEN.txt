Lord of the Hundreds is a superb English ewes’ milk cheese that has much in common with an Italian Pecorino. The texture is grainy, and the cheese is aged to give it a real depth of flavour, while the delicate, rich milk leaves a creamy, sweet taste in the mouth.

Lord of The Hundreds takes its name from Saxon times. The ’Lord’, or 9th century tax collector for the king, controlled 100 parcels of land, and there remains to this day a monument to this practice at the farm where the cheese is made.

The Dyball family acquired the Traditional Cheese Dairy in the village of Stonegate, East Sussex, in November 2002 after turning their backs on lives of insurance broking and banking.

The family is committed to producing high quality, hand-made, traditional cheeses, using only raw milk from single farm herds. They are equally committed to animal welfare, and have recently received a Good Dairy Commendation by the globally respected farm animal welfare organisation, Compassion in World Farming.

Silver winner at the 2017 Mondial du Fromage.
