Devon Oke cheese dates back to the 17th century, and is thought to be even older than Cheddar cheese. Rachel Stephens, the cheese-maker, discovered the recipe only 20 years ago, and was delighted to be able to re-create a lost tradition.

Her cows’ milk cheese has a smooth yet firm texture, and a mellow, creamy flavour. She washes the curds to give a flavour that is more mellow and sweeter than Cheddar.
One of the original artisan cheese pioneers, Rachel Stephens now produces the cheese on her farm at Stockbeare. Rachel has developed many cheeses, but still remains true to her original creation, Devon Oke. It takes its name from the nearby village of Okehampton.
