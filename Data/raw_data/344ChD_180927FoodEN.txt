Proudly made by Julianna Sedli, this is an English take on the French Classic Reblochon. Julianna has been making cheese for just over 8 years. She trained with the American cheese maker Judy Schadi who was so impressed with Julianna, that she named a cheese after her. Made with unpasteurised organic Jersey milk, this English cheese may soon rival the French classic Reblochon from which it draws inspiration.
