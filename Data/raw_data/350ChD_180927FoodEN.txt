Traditional Cheddar Cheese Truckle 1.9kg

Mature Traditional Bandaged Cheddar Truckle, approximately 1.9kg. Award winning maker. A whole cheese is approximately 17cm diameter and 8cm high. You can cut this cheese as you would a cake. Cover any cut surfaces with clingfilm. If you are going to keep the cheese for some time, remove the cheesecloth completely as this will impart a musty taste to the cut cheese.
Made with vegetarian rennet


A good flavoured moist cheese of consistently good quality. In our experience, some good Cheddar makers cannot make good small cheeses - we have to chooses makers of truckles carefully.
