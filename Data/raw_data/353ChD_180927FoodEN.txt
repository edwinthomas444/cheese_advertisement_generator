Farm Double Gloucester Cheese - Godsells
 
Farm Double Gloucester Cheese made by the Godsells family. Mellow, but mature, nutty cheese with a flaky texture. Made less than ten miles from our shop. Gold Medal Winner - British Cheese Awards. We think this is the best Double Gloucester we have ever tasted and not to be confused with tasteless Gloucester sold at many supermarkets.
Made with vegetarian rennet

This is a relatively new Double Gloucester made by the Godsell family at their farm at Leonard Stanley, Gloucestershire. We are particularly pleased to be able to stock a good quality Double which is actually made in the county - these days, much of the cheese is made in the north of England. This Double is firm-textured with a good colour and natural crusty rind - an excellent ploughman's cheese.
