We are often asked the difference between Single and Double Gloucester. Single can only be made in Gloucestershire itself (this one is made by the Godsell family at Leonard Stanley.) Double is always coloured, whereas Single is not. Traditionally, other factors were also involved, such as size, weight, and type of milk used, but nowadays these do not always apply.
