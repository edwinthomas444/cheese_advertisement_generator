Thomas Hoe Stevenson Aged Leicestershire Red is traditionally made in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, where it is buttered, cloth bound, and matured for approximately 6 months which produces a flaky open texture and a lemony, slightly sweet, nutty caramelised flavour reminiscent of the varieties produced in the County from where it originated centuries ago.
