Devon Oke has been one of our most popular cheeses over the last fifteen years. It is made at Stockbeare Farm on the edge of Dartmoor by Rachel Stephens to a seventeenth century cheese recipe she found in her attic. The cheese is matured for six months during which time it develops a smooth rich-smelling crust and a wonderful firm, moist, creamy interior.
