This is one of the very few cheeses made in East Anglia and it is particularly unusual to find a cheese from Lincolnshire (which is partly fen and partly given over to arable farming). Poacher is matured for about a year and has a clean sweet tang with a slight earthiness. During the cheese making the curds are scalded and stirred until it 'is springy and squeaks between the teeth' - according to the cheese maker. This one is the vintage version which is matured for almost two years. Former 'cheese of the year' at the London Cheese Awards.
