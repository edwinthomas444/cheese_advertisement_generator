If you have never bought or received a whole baby Stilton before, here are some tips for cutting and storing. You can either cut the truckle in half (should you want to keep half for another occasion) or you should cut a slice or cap, approximately 1cm, off the top. The best way to cut is by using a cheese wire (dental floss is an easily obtainable alternative) or a sharp knife; score around the cheese first. Cut and serve down the cheese or cut rings. Store in a refrigerator and clingfilm any cut surfaces or apply the cap you removed earlier. Stilton freezes quite well if you have too much to eat within a few days.

Award-winning maker. Known as 'the King of English cheeses' and mentioned by Daniel Defoe. Was first sold at the Bell Inn in Stilton but has never been made there - and by law can only be made in three counties: Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire.
