Only one farm in the country still makes this cheese: Woodbridge Farm near Sturminster Newton. Legend suggests that the cheese was originally blued by dunking old boots and mouldy harness in the milk. The milk itself is skimmed and therefore the fat content of this cheese is only 15 per cent. Traditionally, Blue Vinney was taken to London for sale by Dorset farmers because Londoners "were the only ones daft enough to buy it"! This cheese varies quite a lot in colour and can look different to our picture. Sometimes there are brown patches in addition to the blueing. It's what you get with a handmade artisan product but the taste is always good.
