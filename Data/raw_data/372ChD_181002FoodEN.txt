Named in recognition of Sir Stanley Spencer who lived in the village pub, the White Hartt, from 1939-1940. Whilst there he painted the picture "Village Gossips" which can be seen at Cheltenham Museum and Art Gallery. It shows a group of villagers and himself with his wife Hilda and his lady friend Daphne. Daphne's skirt looks like chives in cheese!
