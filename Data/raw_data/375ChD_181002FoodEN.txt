Sage is a herb which aids digestion and was originally added to this cheese when it used to be a seasonal delicacy eaten over the Christmas period. If you like sage, you will enjoy this good farmhouse cheese, made in the West Midland by Fowlers, who can claim to be the oldest cheesemaking family in Britain; they were making Derby cheese in the Peak District in 1840. This cheese has a layer of real sage and is not at all like the green, marbled, dyed, factory-made Sage Derby most supermarkets sell.
