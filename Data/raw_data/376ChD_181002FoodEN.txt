"We, Simon and Tim Jones, at Lincolnshire Poacher Cheese, are absolutely committed to producing the very best cheese that we possibly can (with a little help from our 230 Holstein Cows!) using only our own unpasteurised milk and traditional methods. We consider ourselves to be extraordinarily lucky to be running a farm in such a beautiful part of the country and to have had the opportunities that the business has given us.
For us, it’s all about the cheese!! We want to make the best tasting cheese, with lots of depth and complexity all of the time, so an awful lot of our energy is spent concentrating on this. We both love cheese of all types and are fascinated by what differentiates the extraordinary from the ordinary. Our cheese is the embodiment of us, our farm, our staff and everything we do on the farm so it is particularly important that we make every effort to produce the best cheese we can because it represents us and everything we do.
In addition to this, we feel very strongly that we have a responsibility to manage the farm and the business as a whole to have as little negative impact on the environment as possible."
