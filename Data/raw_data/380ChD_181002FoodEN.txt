Vulscombe Goat Cheese 170g

Vulscombe Goat Cheese 170g. Fresh-tasting individual goat cheese from Devon.
Made with vegetarian rennet


Vulscombe is a soft, fresh, pasteurised, goats’ milk cheese made without rennet and is therefore suitable for vegetarians. It is produced near Tiverton by Joyce and Graham Townsend. Unlike many other soft cheeses, it is pressed for 24 hours to reduce the moisture content. This contributes to its rich, creamy, mild flavour and its keeping quality. It has a taste of fresh lemon and a hint of goats' milk.
