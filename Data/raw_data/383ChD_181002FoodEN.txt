Leeds Blue
Rich, creamy and piquant
 
Mario Olianas moved to Yorkshire from Italy in 2001.  Hailing from a budding family of Italian gourmets and cheese-makers, Mario uses sheep’s milk from Harrogate to create this smooth, rich and creamy Leeds Blue.

Made by Mario Olianas in Adel, near Leeds, West Yorkshire.

More about this
Brought up in Sardinia, Mario Olianas comes from a strong family of Italian gastronomes.

Moving to Leeds in 2001, he quickly set about realising his passion for food – by setting up Italian supper clubs and baking fine foods.  Upon hearing about his family’s diversification into cheese-making, however, Mario decided he wanted to create a better Italian cheese than his brothers’.

Getting hold of a small vat, he started making cheese in a specially converted room within his house, following an adapted Gorgonzola recipe.  He uses fresh sheep’s milk which he collects daily from just outside Harrogate, and cultures imported from Italy.
