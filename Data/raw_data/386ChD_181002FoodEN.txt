More about this
In 1988 Colston Bassett finally gave up making unpasteurised Stilton.  A change of the Stilton decree in the 1990s meant that unpasteurised Stilton was lost forever because it now had to be made only from pasteurised milk.

Yet in 2006 Joe Schneider set-up on Collingthwaite Farm (on the Wellbeck Estate) to try and recreate an unpasteurised Stilton made on the farm.  Overcoming many obstacles, what he eventually produced, being made from unpasteurised milk, was not allowed to be called Stilton.  So he named it Stichelton.

In producing Stichelton, Joe has created an outstanding British classic.  One of only a few unpasteurised blue cheeses made on a farm, Stichelton is made slowly, with a gentle acidification of the milk and traditional hand-ladling to drain the curd (most is done by machine which treats the curd in a rougher fashion).  It is then rubbed up and allowed to form its classic glossy, ruby-red coat.  Piercing late (about 10-12 weeks) and ageing slowly produces an immensely complex cheese that is not aggressively blue.  Stichelton is toasty, nutty and sweet with a creamy light texture and gentle blue note.
