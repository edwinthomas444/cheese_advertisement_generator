Ogleshield Raclette
Fruity and supple.

 
With his Jersey herd of cows, Jamie Montgomery makes a raclette-style cheese.  Ogleshield is washed for three-months and is perfect for raclette grilling or simply eaten on its own!

A 1.4 kilogram piece(about a quarter of a whole cheese) is ideal for a swing-raclette grill.  Allow 200g-250g per person for cooking as raclette.

Made by Jamie Montgomery in North Cadbury, Somerset, England.

More about this
Jamie Montgomery (of Montgomery Cheddar) developed this cheese whilst looking for a recipe to use his Jersey milk.  Whilst his other milk (Friesian-Holstein) was going into Montgomery’s Cheddar production, Jersey milk is too rich in fat (and the fat globules are too big) to make a good ‘ageing’ cheese.  For a long-time he simply sold it on as liquid milk.

When two Americans visited Montgomery’s on a tour of Europe, however, they were tasked with developing something to do with this milk, in return for learning the secrets of Montgomery’s Cheddar.  They developed a Tomme style, called Shield (because that was what it looked like).  This was sent to affineur Bill Oglethorpe who decided to have a go at washing the cheese and, hey presto, Ogleshield, a washed-rind raclette style cheese, arrived.
