Rollright
Soft, rich and buttery.

 
A mellow, buttery-rich, ‘washed-rind’ cheese that expresses the rich and diverse clover pasture of King Stone Farm deep in the Cotswolds, based on the classic French cheese ‘Reblochon’.

Winner of ‘Supreme Champion’ (Artisan Cheese Awards 2016) and ‘Best Soft Cheese’ (Great British Cheese Awards 2016).

Made by David Jowett at King Stone Farm, Chipping Norton, Cotswolds, England.

More about this
David Jowett studied cheese making with Andy (of The Courtyard Dairy) and went on to work for some of the best cheese-makers in the States and the UK (Gorse Hill Abbey, Berkswell, Jasper Hill, Paxton and Whitfield….).

In early March 2015 he set up in partnership with the Haine family (fifth-generation owners of King Stone Farm) to create a brand new cheese.  The farm contains the ‘King Stone’ – one of the ancient Rollright Stones, a place of special religious and spiritual significance for pagans.

The Haine family farm 30 cows of mixed traditional breeds, mainly Brown Swiss, plus crosses with Jersey, Guernsey, Ayrshire, Shorthorn, Frisian, Holstein, Swedish Red, Simmental…  These cows feed on King Stone Farm’s diverse and plentiful clover and herb pasture (a dozen native grass species!) through spring to autumn.  All the milk from the farm is used in cheese production!

The recipe is similar to that of French washed-rind cheeses, and at three months old, after being regularly washed in brine, it has a thin, orangey-red rind and soft, buttery interior reminiscent of those clover pastures.
