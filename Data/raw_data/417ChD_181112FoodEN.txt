Darling Blue
Smooth, gentle blue with rich biscuity flavours

 
Darling Blue is a newly-created British blue cheese made on Doddington farm, bordering Scotland, using milk fresh from their herd of cows.  It is firm textured and has delicate blue veining, which breaks down the texture and flavour of the cheese to make Darling Blue smooth and creamy with a rich complex flavour.

Made by Maggie Maxwell in Wooler, Northumberland, England.

More about this
The Doddington Farm is run by the Maxwell family.  In the 1950s the family moved from their tenanted farm in west Scotland and bought the small Doddington Farm, situated on a rural outcrop of England overlooked by the Cheviot Hills.  Maggie’s brother, Bob, looks after their 400 Ayrshire, Friesian and Normandy cows.  The fresh milk is piped across the yard to their dairy, some for ice-cream production by brother Neil and his wife Jackie, and some for Maggie to turn into a range of cheeses – ‘Doddington’ and ‘Admiral Collingwood’ perhaps being the most famous.

Darling Blue is the most recent addition to her range.  Matured for 3 months, Darling Blue forms a natural mottled rind which breaks down the paste until it is smooth and creamy, with thin streaks of blue that give the rich biscuity and gentle-blue flavour.

Darling Blue is named after the local Northumberland heroine Grace Darling who, as a 22-year old lighthouse-keeper’s daughter, famously rowed out in appalling weather to save the lives of sailors  whose ship was wrecked on nearby rocks.
