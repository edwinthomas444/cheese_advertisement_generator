STINKING BISHOP

Yes - Stinking Bishop - it is a washed-rind cheese, which generally indicates a powerful aromatic (stinky) cheese...but no, the name has nothing to do with that fact. The name refers to a pear called the Stinking Bishop because Stinking Bishop cheese is immersed every 4 weeks in a brine made of 'perry' - a hard cider made from pears, not apples!


It is thought that Stinking Bishop is based on a cheese once made by Cistercian monks in a nearby village. (Monks have always been associated with the creation of washed-rind cheeses.) When formed, the cheese is encircled with strips of beechwood. This is necessary because when this cheese is aged and fully ripe, it almost achieves puddle-like consistency. It is best to serve Stinking Bishop in a dish for that reason. This is a small-production, notable British cheese, made in Gloucestershire since the 1970s by Charles Martell. The rind is orange to grey and the paste ranges from yellowish-white to beige. The flavor naturally has fruity tones, and a milky consistency; it has a full flavor but not nearly as pungent as its strong aroma might promise. Similar in taste to the French Époisses de Bourgogne. An interesting cheese to try if you can find it.
