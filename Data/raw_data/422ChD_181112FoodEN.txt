COOLEA

Coolea- the 4th among our notable British cheeses, resembles a Dutch Farmhouse (Boeren Kaase) Gouda for good reason - it was first made by Helene and Dick Willems who moved to Ireland from Holland some 20+ years ago. Now their son and daughter-in-law carry on the tradition. The town of Coolea is in County Cork, as is their farm. This is a big prizewinner; in fact it won the award for Best Modern British Cheese in 2007! A semi-hard to hard cheese, Coolea is a traditionally-made farmstead cheese which comes in three sizes: 2, 9 and 19 lb. wheels.

Unlike many farmhouse cheeses, this one has a synthetic plasticote rind. Don't be put off by that - the plasticote actually allows the cheese to breathe. The cheese is typically aged for 6 to 12 months (sometimes longer). The younger versions will be mild, creamy and nutty, whereas the older versions will become more complex, a bit stronger with a hint of caramel, sweet and rich. The interior paste is a satisfying deep yellow and the texture is somewhat chewy. Altogether Coolea is a wonderful cheese you should try.
