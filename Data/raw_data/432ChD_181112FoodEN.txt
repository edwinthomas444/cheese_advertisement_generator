About
The Somerset Cheese Company was founded by long-term friends Philip Rainbow, and Nicholas and Anita Robinson. Based in the beautiful county of Somerset, not far from the famous Bath and West Showground, the Somerset Cheese Company is ideally placed in the heart of farming land. Philip has over 40 years experience in the craft of cheese making and his expertise is well renowned and respected. Philip and Anita worked together for many years before the Somerset Cheese Co. was formed, when Philip was the head cheese maker for a well renowned dairy on the outskirts of Wells in Somerset and Anita was his assistant. Now they have combined their individual talents along with Anita’s husband Nick who brings a wealth of day to day business knowledge.

The milk is sourced from a nearby farm and the name refers to the location of the farm itself. The cheeses are pressed for a period of 24 hours, before being placed in a brine bath for 24 hours and then making it into the maturation rooms. The process of making Pennard Ridge is very labour intensive making it a true 'handmade' cheese.

Pennard Ridge is made using a Caerphilly recipe giving it an open texture with a slightly younger, fresher flavour. There's a hint of salt as a result of the time spent in the brine bath,
