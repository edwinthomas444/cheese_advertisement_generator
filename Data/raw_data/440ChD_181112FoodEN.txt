About
This cheese is made with vegetarian rennet but due to lard being used to adhere the cloth to the rind, it cannot be classed as a vegetarian product.

In the heart of the stunning Bride Valley in Dorset, Paxton & Whitfield's Cheddar Pounders are handmade to a traditional recipe using pasteurised milk from local herds. The Truckles are then taken and matured in the historic Wookey Hole Caves of Wells, Somerset, where the flavour picks up a distinctive complexity from the unique environment.

Wookey Hole Caves have existed for millions of years, and first provided a safe and comfortable place to live for the Celtic People of the Iron Age, as then, like now, they held a consistent temperature of 11 degrees celcius.The cheeses are kept in these caves to mature for up to three months.

This is a specialist cheese which is made to exacting specifications regarding geography, milk source and recipe, earning it a coveted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO).

Paxton's Cave Aged Cheddar Pounder is distinctively fruity and has a nutty bite. It has underlying earthy notes absorbed from its maturation period in the caves at Wookey Hole, and a very dense consistency that is satisfying in the mouth.

Once home, this cheese should be stored in a refrigerator and turned every few days to distribute the moisture evenly throughout the cheese. Please note the cloth should be removed before eating. This can easily be done with a knife.
