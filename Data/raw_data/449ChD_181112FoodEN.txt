Strathearn
Strathearn whisky washed cheese

Strathearn is a semi-soft cows milk cheese which is matured for 4 weeks, during which it gets washed in brine containing Glenturret 10 year old single malt whisky every two days. This washing produces a truly remarkable cheese with a sweet, lactic paste contrasting wonderfully with the pungent, flavoursome rind. We've only recently started stocking this cheese in our London cheese shop but whenever we get a new batch in it sells out almost instantly.

Strathearn was only launched in January of 2016 but that year won a Gold Medal at the World Cheese Awards for it's unique flavour. Another fine example of the innovation currently present in the British cheese industry.

What would we pair this cheese with? Oatcakes and single malt of course. Beautiful.
