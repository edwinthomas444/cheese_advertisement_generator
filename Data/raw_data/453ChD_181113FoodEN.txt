Ribblesdale Superior Goat
Ribblesdale superior goats cheese

Another award winning cheese from Ribblesdale Cheese Company in Yorkshire, their wax coated Superior Goat is a fantastic cheese. Strikingly white, smooth texture and a subtle nuttiness associated with good goats cheese. Made in Hawes, North Yorkshire with local milk, which makes a real difference to the cheese as the Yorkshire Dales provide excellent grazing with the natural pastures and high rainfall.

We use it on cheeseboards, toasties, sandwiches, the lot and we're never disappointed. If you're feeling indulgent then bake it with figs and wash it down with a Merlot.

This cheese is suitable for vegetarians.
