Black Bomber

Creamy & smooth extra mature Cheddar loved for its depth of flavour.


Where Cheddars are concerned, our multi-award winning Little Black Bomber is a modern classic. Our flagship cheese marries a delicious rich flavour with a smooth creaminess, lasting long on the palate but remaining demandingly moreish!

Black Bomber has won awards at The Great British Cheese Awards, Nantwich International Cheese Awards, the World Cheese Awards and a Super Gold at Mondial Fromage in France.
