Celtic Promise

Celtic Promise is a raw-milk washed-rind cheese made by John Savage-Onstwedder on his organic family farm in the Teifi Valley. Celtic Promise has a delicate buttery texture and a distinctively pungent aroma. It starts life as a Caws Teifi Caerphilly and is then washed with cider twice a week for seven weeks so the cheese develops its moist pink rind.

Celtic Promise has won countless awards over the years, and is one of only two cheeses in Britain to have been awarded the title of Supreme Champion twice at the British Cheese Awards. It was also one of only six British cheeses to have been awarded a 3 star Great Taste Award in 2018.
