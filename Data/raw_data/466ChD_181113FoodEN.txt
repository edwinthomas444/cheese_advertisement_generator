Caws Teifi

Natural

Teifi Natural is a Gouda-style cheese with a dense, smooth and creamy texture. Its mellow, slightly sweet flavour becomes deeper and richer with age and when very mature develops characteristics similar to Parmesan cheese.

This cheese is very versatile and loses nothing when heated. It's excellent when toasted or grilled; as it melts in strings and it's great on pizza. Ideal for those who are after good flavour without too much intensity.
