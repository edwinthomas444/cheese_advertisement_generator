RED LEICESTER
With its unmistakable colour and
satisfyingly firm texture,
Red Leicester is a true English classic.

At Arla’s traditional Taw Valley creamery in Devon, the master cheesemakers pride themselves on crafting the finest Red Leicester.

The time-honoured recipe involves sourcing fresh quality milk which is gently pasteurised and put into cheese vats. Starter cultures and vegetarian rennet are added to produce curds. Once the curds and whey are separated and the curds milled, salt is added to slow the process and act as a preservative and flavour enhancer.

 

But this cheese has another unique addition – annatto, a natural food colouring extracted from the South American Achiote or ‘Lipstick’ tree – and it is this which gives the Red Leicester its distinctive russet red colour.

The expert graders at Taw Valley use all their skill to ensure this cheese boasts a beautiful even red hue with an open, rugged texture which breaks with a lovely ‘carrot snap’. Further signs of perfection is the subtle flecks of yellow within the red.

Flavour-wise, Red Leicester is savoury with a touch of sweetness and subtle nutty notes. Famed for its versatility, this cheese melts extremely well and is fabulous crumbled into sauces and soups. And of course with its striking red-orange tone, Red Leicester brings a splash of colour to any cheeseboard.
