DOUBLE GLOUCESTER
This famous English cheese is a must-have on any self-respecting cheeseboard and a fine counterbalance to more pungent varieties.

Tucked away in a beautiful corner of Devon you’ll discover Arla’s Taw Valley creamery, where our Double Gloucester is made.

Still made to a traditional recipe, the freshest local milk is gently pasteurised into the cheese vats. Starter cultures and vegetarian rennet are added to produce curds. Once the curds and whey are separated and the curds milled, salt is added to slow the process and act as a preservative and flavour enhancer.

For Double Gloucester, a touch of annatto is added to the cheese vat – a natural food colouring extracted from the South American Achiote or ‘Lipstick’ tree – to give the cheese its beautiful straw colour.

Taw Valley’s skilled graders are passionate about their Double Gloucester. That’s why they watch so carefully over the maturation process to ensure the end result is perfection itself: cheese with a silky smooth, close-knit texture and mild savoury flavour with sweet notes and a lovely buttery mouth-feel.

Double Gloucester is most at home on the cheeseboard, where it can be enjoyed with crackers and biscuits or complemented by English orchard fruits such as apples and pears.
