Strong & Creamy

STILTON
As the ‘King of English Cheese’, Stilton is the most popular of all the Blues.

Arla’s legendary Tuxford & Tebbutt creamery in Melton Mowbray has been handcrafting Stilton since 1780, making it the world’s longest surviving maker of this noble cheese. Indeed, it is one of just six creameries in the world permitted to make Blue Stilton.

Stilton has acquired Protected Designation Origin status and can only be made in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire using milk exclusively farmed from the same three counties.

Traditionally produced in open vats using pasteurised milk, the cheese is salted and milled into hoops where it gets turned for around five days

 

before being transferred to the maturing stores. Here, it is individually matured and lovingly graded by hand at regular intervals to create the perfect Stilton.

The result? A satisfyingly rich cheese with rounded, complex flavours with a piquant finish and a smooth creamy mouth feel.

Stilton has been celebrated for centuries by cheese lovers, as can be seen in a 19th century saying from the village of Wymondham: ‘Drink a pot of ale, eat a scoop of Stilton, every day, you will make ‘old bones’.

This majestic cheese is particularly versatile. Always allow Stilton to reach room temperature to bring out the full flavour, then simply enjoy a generous chunk with crackers or selection of fruits and a glass of port. It’s also a prized cooking cheese which can bring a smooth, tangy richness to soups, sauces and salads.
