SHROPSHIRE BLUE
Made alongside our famous Stilton at the Tuxford & Tebbutt creamery, Shropshire Blue is also a very popular and high quality Blue. The cheese has a strong nutty flavour and delightfully smooth and creamy texture.

Made in a similar process to Stilton, the cheese is produced using pasteurised milk and is salted and milled into hoops before being transferred to the maturing stores to mature.Our expert cheesemakers are very precise in making sure the exact quantities of ingredients are added to perfect its strong and creamy characteristics that is known for.

 

The main factor that differentiates this cheese from other Blues is its rich orange colour which creates a beautiful contrast between the delicate blue veins. This is created by adding a natural food colouring called Annatto to the cheese mixture.

The cheese was first made in the 1970s at the Castle Stuart dairy in Inverness by a cheesemaker who had trained in Stilton making in Nottinghamshire. Originally known as Blue Stuart or Inverness-shire Blue, the cheese was marketed as Shropshire Blue despite having no links to Shropshire. Today it is more commonly produced in the East Midlands alongside its cousin, Stilton.
