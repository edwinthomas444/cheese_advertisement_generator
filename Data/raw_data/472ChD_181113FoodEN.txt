Thick and Creamy

COTTAGE CHEESE
Made at our high tech Stourton creamery, our award winning Cottage Cheese is deliciously thick and creamy with a generous silky dressing and melting texture.

Unlikely many other cheeses, Cottage Cheese can be enjoyed straight away due to its quick fermentation process and due to there being no maturing needed. As well as natural Cottage Cheese, we make a wide range including pineapple, onion and chive and sweet chilli – and all versions regularly feature in national and international awards.

 

So what makes our Cottage Cheese so special? Karen Betton, master cheesemaker from Stourton creamery, was in no doubt:

“It’s all in the curd…ours is more defined and in large chunks – it’s easily recognisable.”

The history of Cottage Cheese can be traced back to its roots as a farm house cheese, where quick fermentation means it can enjoyed straight away without maturing. And since it’s low in fat and high in protein, this moist, crumbly cheese is perfectly suited to today’s healthy eating trends.

Lovely enjoyed as a snack by the spoonful with crackers, this potted cheese is also perfect for picnics or meals on the go. Of course no jacket spud or salad would be complete without a good dollop of our Cottage Cheese.
