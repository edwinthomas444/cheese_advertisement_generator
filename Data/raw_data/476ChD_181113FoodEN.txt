Redesdale
Description
Tasting Notes
A sweet, subtle sheep's cheese. It has a rich, velvety texture, clean characteristic taste and refreshing tang. Those of you who hear 'sheep's milk' and are concerned that it will have the same strong character as a goat's cheese; try it. The subtle and enticing flavour will surprise you! 

Cheese History
Redesdale has a thirty-year-old history, and is extra special to us because it is the first cheese we ever made! Originally called Redesdale Sheep's Dairy, Marc Robertson's company at Soppit Farm in Otterburn made small batches of Redesdale ewe's milk cheese; legend has it that Marc made his first batch in buckets in the kitchen sink! It remains a very trusted product in our cheese portfolio, and wins its fair share of awards!

A wonderful cheese to try if you want a change from goat's cheese. 

Please note that this sheep's milk cheese is pasteurised and vegetarian. It is suitable for pregnant women.
