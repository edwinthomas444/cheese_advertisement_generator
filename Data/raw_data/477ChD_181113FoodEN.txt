Chevington

Description
Chevington Cheese has a unique history; it was first produced in 1895 by Mr John W Annett in Chevington, Northumberland. However, just a few years after being introduced to the market the death of Mr Annett in 1903 resulted in the end of the line for Chevington Cheese.The Cheese was revived in 2001 by our very own Marc Robertson, who founded Northumberland Cheese Company. He was able to track down the original recipe created by Mr Annett, at the Northumberland Records Office and revived the Chevington Cheese. For a true taste of wild Northumbrian history, try Chevington!

Tasting Notes
A smooth, creamy, mould-ripened cheese with a sharp, clean bite leading to a gentle richness. Tastes not far off a hard English brie. Mad using pasteurised Jersey Cows' Milk from local Jersey herds (at Wheelbirk's Farm in Corbridge, Northumberland) andvegetarian rennet. An easy cheese to love and a major prizewinner.

Chevington is pasteurised and vegetarian. It is suitable for pregnant women.
