Kielder

Description
Northumberland Kielder cheese is made from Jersey milk from the single-herd at Wheelbirk's Farm in Corbridge, Northumberland.

Tasting Notes
Kielder is based on a Gouda recipe. The high-fat content of the milk means that the cheese is not pressed; the weight of the curds presses out the whey naturally, and the result is an open-textured, deliciously creamy cheese. The Kielder has an edge of citrus on the end note, and works beautifully with grapes, or melts beautifully in a cheese and ham toastie. 

Please note that this cheese is pasteurised and vegetarian. It is suitable for pregnant women.
