Coquetdale
Description
Cheese History
The Coquetdale recipe developed from a trip Marc made to France in the late 90s, where he visited Puy-de-Dôme, in the Auvergene region famous for Saint-Nectaire cheese. After spending a couple of weeks making cheese with the farmers, Marc returned to Northumberland to adapt the recipe and make our own version that played to the strengths of the milk we use.
