Hadrian
Description
Tasting Notes
Named after the great wall in Northumberland, Hadrian cheese is based on the Coquetdale recipe, so it is a creamy and fresh-tasting cow's milk cheese, with the addition of caraway seeds, which are traditionally added to Gouda in Holland. The seeds give an aromatic and fragrant taste, making a delicious pairing with the fresh-tasting cheese. This is a distinctive and unusual cheese, which is a treat for cheese-lovers who would like something a bit different. 

Please note that this is cheese is pasteurised and vegetarian. It is suitable for pregnant women.
