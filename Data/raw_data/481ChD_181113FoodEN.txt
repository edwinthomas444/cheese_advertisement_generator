Stoney Cross
Lyburn Stoney Cross
Stoney Cross is our most recent offering from Lyburn Farmhouse Cheesemakers. The cheese comes as a 1Kg truckle or a 3.0Kg wheel, mould ripened, not dissimilar to a French Tomme De Savoie. At 8 weeks old it is creamy, buttery in texture, sweet flavours, with a distinctly earthy  finish. The name Stoney Cross comes from an old World War II airfield 2 miles to the South of us.

This cheese suits a very broad section of customer. Even those that like a strong cheese will enjoy the subtle flavours and the smooth texture of this little cheese. British Cheese Awards have produced a Bronze medal for Stoney Cross in 2017.

More recently a Gold at the International Cheese Awards Nantwich, followed by a Two Star Gold at the Great Taste Awards.
