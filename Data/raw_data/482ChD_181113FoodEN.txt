Lyburn’s Winchester
Lyburn Winchester
In the early days it became clear, that although we had decided not to make cheddar, for all the obvious reasons, Southern England, likes its hard yellow cheese, so we took the Lyburn Gold on to 9 months. Now we have a cheese that is clearly not a cheddar, but not a typical Gouda, you could argue it is somewhere between the two.

This we have achieved, by small changes to the make and now maturing the cheeses on to 8/9 months. This cheese still has an element of creaminess to it with a subtle nuttiness in flavour. As can be seen below, Winchester has been consistently getting results in the competitions and added a Bronze at the 2016 British Cheese Awards and yet another in 2017.
