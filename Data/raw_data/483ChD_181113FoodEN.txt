Cornish Crumbly
Cornish Crumbly
Creamy, lively young Lancashire-style mould ripened cheese with a real zing on the finish! This cheese will appeal to cheese lovers everywhere. Vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cows’ milk.

Cornish Crumbly is made by scooping soft lumps of curd, just after it has been cut; into shallow cloth-lined molds. The curd is not heated or stirred, and is only pressed under it’s own weight so it remains soft and retains a lot of whey throughout ripening. This is what gives Cornish Crumbly a lively acidity. Next day, a little dry salt is rubbed onto the cheeses and they are put in the maturing room to ripen for 4 weeks.

Cornish Crumbly is light in texture and is wonderful for cooking or crumbling into fresh salads, or simply delicious with a rich fruit jelly.
