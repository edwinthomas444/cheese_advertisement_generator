Cornish Smuggler
A creamy traditional farm house flavour with beautiful red marbling throughout. Vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cows’ milk.

A year ago, I was asked to produce a traditional farmhouse cheese which looked attractive on a cheeseboard. Cornish Smuggler.

I came up with a traditional farmhouse recipe, which gives the cheese a traditional flavour with a balanced acidity and creamy texture which is protected by a natural attractive pink / grey mould rind.

In addition, I add annatto, a water soluble vegetarian food colouring which is naturally derived from the seed pods of the Bixa Orellana tree. This gives a wonderful soft red veining throughout the cheese whilst not interfering with the development of flavour.

The result is a spectacular, colourful slice of flavoursome cheese which livens up any cheeseboard or cubed into salads or melted on toast looks and tastes fantastic.
