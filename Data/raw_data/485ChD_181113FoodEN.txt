Keltic Gold
Keltic Gold
Pungent WASHED RIND cheese, creamy smooth texture and round full sweet flavour reminiscent of French Alpine cheeses. Vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cows’ milk.

Local cider from Cornish Orchards is used to dip and scrub each cheese three times a week which gives apple overtones to the pate and a distinctive edible orange rind.

Keltic Gold is made exactly like Miss Muffet, but instead of joining my other cheeses in the maturing room on the wooden shelves that nurture the pink/grey mould spores, I put the cheeses into a separate room where they are dipped in Cornish cider three times each week and scrubbed by hand, over the 4 – 6 week ripening period. This encourages the pungent edible golden rind which gives Keltic Gold its distinctive flavour and appearance.

Melts down beautifully, use a sprinkling of nutmeg for a Swiss-style fondue sauce!
