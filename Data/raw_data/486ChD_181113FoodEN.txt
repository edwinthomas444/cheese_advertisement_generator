Miss Muffet
Sweet continental style washed curd cheese with a supple texture and nutty creamy flavour – unique pink/grey natural mould rind, peculiar to my maturing room!

Matured for 4 – 6 weeks veg. rennet, pasteurised cows’ milk.

I WASH THE CURD by tipping warm water onto the curd pieces and vigorously wash them, squooshing them around so the whey is physically washed out of the curd.

Miss Muffet ripens over a period of 4 – 6 weeks, developing a sweet flavour and a supple texture as the thoroughly washed curd holds little whey, so the cheese has little acidity.

Try enjoying Miss Muffet baked with honey and almonds as a starter!
