Heart 400g Organic Cheddar in a Gift Box

A deliciously soft and creamy Vintage Organic Cheddar in our iconic heart shape, enrobed in our distinctive burgundy wax and packaged in an attractive gift box.

The cheddar itself is matured for up to 12 months, at which point we select the very best cheese to be made into one of our award-winning truckles. It has a rich depth of flavour without the acidity that is sometimes associated with vintage cheddar, giving it a full and rounded flavour with a smooth and creamy texture.

All of our cheeses are certified as organic by the Soil Association and as such contain no artificial preservatives. If you would like to find out more about our commitment to organic farming, have a read of our About Us page!

Our smooth and rich Vintage Organic Cheddar is also available in a smaller 200g size through our various stockists.

Ordering for Christmas? All our best before dates are well into the new year!
