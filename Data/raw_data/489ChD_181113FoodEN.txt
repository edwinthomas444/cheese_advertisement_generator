2kg Vintage Organic Cheddar in Gift Box

A 2kg truckle of our deliciously creamy Vintage Organic Cheddar enrobed in our iconic burgundy wax, packaged in an attractive gift box.

The cheddar itself is matured for up to 12 months, at which point we select the very best cheese to be made into one of our award-winning truckles. It has a rich depth of flavour without the acidity that is sometimes associated with vintage cheddar, giving it a full and rounded flavour with a smooth and creamy texture.

All of our cheeses are certified as organic by the Soil Association and as such contain no artificial preservatives. If you would like to find out more about our commitment to organic farming, have a read of our About Us page!

Our smooth and rich Vintage Organic Cheddar is also available in a smaller 200g size through our various stockists.

Ordering for Christmas? All our best before dates are well into the new year!

How to Store Me
All of our cheeses are organic which means that they don't contain any preservatives other than salt and will require storing below 5 degrees celsius. In order to enjoy your Godminster cheese at its best, allow it come up to room temperature an hour before serving to bring out all the lovely flavours. The wax forms a natural protection around the cheddar and can be cut away as you go. Either score around the top and use it as a lid, scooping the cheese out, or cut through the wax like you would a cake. If there's any left afterward then replace the wax as best you can, wrap it in cling film (or cheese paper if available) and refrigerate.
