LANDAFF CREAMERY
KINSMAN RIDGE

DEB AND DOUG ERB's debut cheese, Landaff, was designed with approachability and versatility in mind. They aim for something more daring with this second creation; Kinsman Ridge is inspired by funky French tommes like St. Nectaire, a style that's enviably more common in Europe than on this side of the pond.
SENSORY NOTES  - Kinsman Ridge is a semi-soft, tomme-style cheese with aromas of fresh butter, forest and cured meat. Young wheels are washed with brine before a natural, mottled rind is cultivated. As it matures, Kinsman's interior transitions from smooth and firm to a giving and creamy consistency. Flavors are rich, savory, and softly floral, with hints of roasted artichoke and asparagus.

PAIRING AND SERVICE  - Kinsman's rustic appearance and decadent texture make it a perfect choice for a composed cheese board or plate. Try pairing with a Sauvignon Blanc, wheat beer, or saucisson sec. Though mottled in appearance, the cultivated, mixed rind is delicate enough to be palatable and does not need to be removed before portioning.
