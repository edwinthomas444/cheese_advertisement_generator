JASPER HILL CREAMERY
LITTLE HOSMER

LITTLE HOSMER is a Jasper Hill Creamery original, our mini version of a new world-style brie.  This cheese is named for a small pond in nearby Craftsbury, Vermont.  Little Hosmer Pond is adjacent to Great Hosmer Pond, both favorite destinations for rowing, swimming, fishing and cross-country skiing after a long day of cheesemaking. Naming this little cheese after a Northeast Kingdom gem ties out our quest for meaningful work in a place that we love.

SENSORY NOTES - Little Hosmer is an approachable and nuanced soft ripened cheese. Beneath its thin, bloomy-rind lies a gooey, milky core showing a complex array of flavors at peak ripeness: cauliflower, crème fraiche, and toasted nuts.  A bright, clean finish with a hint of white mushroom aroma follows the rich flavors of the paste.

PAIRING AND SERVICE - Little Hosmer is perfect size for a picnic, or complement to a cheese board.  At room temperature, this cheese is pliable and decadent without being runny.  Seek out a fruited wheat beer, cured duck breast, and freshly baked focaccia for an elegant little spread.
