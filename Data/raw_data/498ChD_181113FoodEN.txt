SCHOLTEN FAMILY FARM
WEYBRIDGE

PATTY AND ROGER SCHOLTEN manage a herd of Dutch Belt cows in the rolling landscape of Weybridge, VT. Organic, high quality milk production has helped the Scholtens survive a competitive milk market. Farmstead cheese is now a way to diversify the business and include the next generation - their daughter’s family has come on board to help run the farm and creamery.

WEYBRIDGE is an organic, lactic-set cheese with a delicate bloomy rind. The lightly aged style is meant to showcase the Scholtens’ rich and complex Dutch Belt milk. The thin rind surrounds a delicate cream-line, showing a toasty, mushroomy flavor in contrast to the bright acidity of the dense, milky core.

PAIRING AND SERVICE - The small medallion format appeals to any occasion – a snack for two or a garnish for a larger spread. Weybridge’s rich, milky flavor makes it an ideal breakfast cheese alongside berry preserves and freshly-baked bread. Classic beverage pairings include dry, bubbly white wine, sparkling apple cider or a crisp German pilsner.
