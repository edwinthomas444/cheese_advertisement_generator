Bagborough Brie
This creamy English brie is made from Guernsey cows milk and has a lovely golden colour and rich creamy flavour.
TASTING NOTES
Made using Guernsey cows milk, this delightful little brie has a rich golden centre with a thick white, bloomy rind. The flavour is mild, creamy and intensely buttery. Created by Whitelake who make exceptional, award winning cheeses. This is a wonderfully unctuous English Brie, a great alternative to the traditional style and is especially tasty drizzled with honey.
