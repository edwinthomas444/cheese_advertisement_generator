TASTING NOTES
A pale apricot coloured handmade, unpasteurised, farmhouse Cheshire, with a loose, crumbly texture and salty, tangy flavour which is said to emanate from the salt deposits beneath the Nantwich meadows. Cheshire is considered to be the oldest British cheese in existence, probably dating back to Roman times and indeed is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The cheeses are considered to be at their best with a little extra maturation. Great for the cheeseboard, perhaps with a glass of ale, or in cooking – perfect grilled, baked or crumbled in salads.
