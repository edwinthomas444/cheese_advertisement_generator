TASTING NOTES
Baron Bigod is an exquisite Suffolk made, bloomy unpasteurised cows milk cheese. It is a large 28cm diameter round cheese, made in the style of a good Brie de Meaux with the unique and delicate milky flavours of the Montbeliarde cows milk, combined with rich, earthy mushroom notes.  The protein-rich milk is perfect for cheesemaking and may also be more easily digestible to some who have milk intolerances. In France, this much sought after milk from this traditional breed is used to produce some of the finest cheeses in the world, such as Comte and Vacherin Mont d’Or.

Hand-made by Jonny & Dulcie Cricklemore, the family use only gravity-fed milk to protect the fragile fat globules in the milk during production, with no pumps at any stage. The curds are carefully hand-ladled into large round moulds, using traditional pelle-a-brie ladles, the young cheeses are hand salted and aged for up to 8 weeks in a humid cave-like environment to allow the flavours to develop. The cheese has a great depth of flavour and a lovely golden hue to the rich paste. One of our current favourite cheeses
