TASTING NOTES
A full flavoured, steely blue, ewes milk cheese, handmade by Robin Congdon near the Dart River in Devon. This cheese has a pronounced flavour, strong, sweet and spicy, with a hint of Brazil nuts in the finish. Moist and slightly crumbly in texture and not over blued. Usually matured for around six months, this cheese is particularly good in early summer when the ewe’s milk is abundant. It could be compared to a Roquefort in style, yet not quite so overtly creamy and with a little less salt.
