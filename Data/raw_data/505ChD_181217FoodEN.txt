TASTING NOTES
A superb, hard-rinded, unpasteurised ewe’s milk cheese, made using natural rennet, that is released when aged around 4 months.  Delicious lingering, mouth-filling flavour with hints of caramel and a definite tang on the finish. This cheese is a regular Award Winner.  Handmade on their farm by Stephen and Sheila Fletcher to exacting high standards and could be compared to a good Manchego in style, flavour and finish. A magnificent looking amonite shaped cheese with distinctive ridges and unusual markings on the thick rind. It weighs around 3kg.  Its firm texture also makes it ideal for grating for use in pasta & gratin recipes.
