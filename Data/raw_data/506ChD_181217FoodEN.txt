TASTING NOTES
A golden hued blue cheese with a creamy texture and a buttery, distinctive bite. From the award winning Butlers dairy. The colour is obtained by the use of Annatto which is a natural product of a South American shrub and the cheese is pierced to create the beautiful blue veins. Foil wrapped. A British classic that has been called ‘the daddy of all blue cheeses’ by Simon Rimmer.
