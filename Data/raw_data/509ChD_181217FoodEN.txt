TASTING NOTES
Regarded as one of the best traditionally made naturally crusted Stiltons in the country, this cheese is mature, with good blueing and rich, deep, herbaceous flavours that linger on the palate. Mellow and creamy, this cheese is aged for at least eight weeks and is made according to time-honoured traditional methods. Stilton was first recognised as a type of cheese at the beginning of the eighteenth century and named after the town of Stilton. The cheese PDO status, and can only be made in the three adjacent counties of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. COLSTON BASSETT & DISTRICT DAIRY Limited was built in 1913, set up as a cooperative and funded by a group of local people. The milk is largely produced from the same pastures.
