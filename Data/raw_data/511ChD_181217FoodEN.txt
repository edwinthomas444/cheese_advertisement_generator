Cornish Yarg
The cheese is light textured with fresh citrus notes. The cheeses are carefully wrapped in nettle leaves, giving a distinctive finish and subtle herbaceous flavour.
TASTING NOTES
Cornish Yarg was first made on a farm on the edge of BODMIN MOOR in the early 1980s. Alan Gray (who gave Yarg its now famous name by reversing the spelling of his own) sold the recipe to neighbouring farmer Michael Horrell a few years later. In 1995, Ben and Catherine Mead, looking for ways of farm diversification, came on board and so their happy relationship with Cornish Yarg began. As demand for Cornish Yarg grew, a second dairy was built at Pengreep – the Mead family farm for the past 500 years – with all production finally moving there in 2006. The cheese is light textured with fresh citrus notes. The young, fresh cheeses are carefully wrapped in nettle leaves, giving a distinctive finish and subtle herbaceous flavour.
