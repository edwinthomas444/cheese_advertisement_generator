TASTING NOTES
A firm bodied cheese, made to traditional methods by Fowlers of Earlswood. The cheese is tasty and nutty with the addition of fresh tasting sage which adds specks of green to the pale cheese. Matured for nine months for a full flavour. The Fowlers have been making cheese for fourteen generations and luckily we can benefit from those three hundred years of experience!
