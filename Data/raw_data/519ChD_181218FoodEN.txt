TASTING NOTES
Golden Cross is a soft, ash-coated log-shaped Goats cheese that is hand-made Kevin and Alison Blunt on their farm at Whitesmith in East Sussex. As the cheese ages its characteristics subtley change and it becomes more distinctive and complex with maturity. Before maturing the cheese is lightly charcoaled. The charcoal provides a nice contrast to the whiteness of the goat’s cheese and alters the acidity of the surface of the cheese which aids maturation. The body of the cheese is dense, creamy and full flavoured. 

Each log is approx. 225g.
