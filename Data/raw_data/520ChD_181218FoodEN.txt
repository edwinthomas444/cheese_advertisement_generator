TASTING NOTES
This is an award winning cheese that strikes a close resemblance to a French Epoisse. Semi soft in texture, the cheeses are washed twice weekly for several weeks to promote the development of a golden rind, similar to a peach skin. As a washed rind cheese it is pungent on the nose and the flavour strong with soft, creamy notes. A delicious individual cheese that is perfect for baking in the oven, we suggest dipping crispy roast potatoes in!
