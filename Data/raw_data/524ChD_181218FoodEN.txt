TASTING NOTES
A cheese from the makers of LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER cheese, made using fresh unpasteurised local milk. Loosely based on an old fashioned traditional Red Leicester recipe, this cheese is matured for around 4-6 months and is made using vegetarian rennet. Annatto, a natural colour obtained from the seed of the ANCHIOTE TREE from South America is added to give the cheese its rich full “red” colour. The cheese is made on the farm in large 20kg drum shaped truckles and has a clean, delicate nutty flavour. The perfect cheese to include in a Ploughmans Lunch with a glass of craft beer and a fruity chutney
