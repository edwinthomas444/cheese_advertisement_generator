TASTING NOTES
Norfolk White Lady is a soft, bloomy Brie-like hand-made cheese using milk from a 60-strong herd of white Friesland sheep, which graze in the Black Fens, in Wymondham. “Norfolk isn’t known for dairy,” says cheesemaker Jane Murray, “but my patch of land has richer, wetter soil than other parts of the county. The flavour is mild and creamy with a rich finish.

The individual cheese weighs approx 200g.
