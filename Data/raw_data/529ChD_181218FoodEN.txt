Old Winchester
A firm pressed pasteurised cows’ milk cheese with a washed rind and bags of flavour.
TASTING NOTES
Affectionally known as “Old Smales”, Old Winchester is a firm pressed, washed curd, pasteurised cows’ milk cheese. Handmade by Mike & Judy Smales on their farm in Wiltshire, the cheese has a crunchy crystalline texture and a flavour that becomes more intense and pronounced with age. The cheese is matured for about 18 months and is reminiscent of an Aged Gouda with a distinctive nuttiness in the flavour profile. Old Winchester is made with vegetarian rennet and can used as a veggie friendly replacement for Parmesan Reggiano, the famous Italian cheese, used in pasta and gratin dishes. Delicious as a table cheese with fresh fruits.
