TASTING NOTES
This is a Semi – Firm, goat’s cheese, handmade by Peter Humphreys at White Lake Dairy, on Bagborough Farm in Shepton Mallet in Somerset. It has a firm texture, with a gentle lingering flavour and a lightly washed rind. A delightfully fragrant cheese, for those who enjoy a cheese which is not too strong or overly ‘goaty’ on the finish. Rachel is the namesake of Pete’s (the cheesemakers) friend who, much like the cheese, is sweet, curvy and just a little bit nutty!
