TASTING NOTES
A soft textured washed rind cheese that develops a distinctive, meaty pungency with age. The cheese is handmade by Charles Martell on his farm in the heart of Gloucestershire. The name of the cheese is derived from the variety of pear “Stinking Bishop”, the juice of which is made into a “perry” and is used to wash the cheese. This gives the cheese its distinctive nose. The cheese should be the texture of thick clotted cream but on occasions is spoonable rather than sliceable! Stinking Bishop was made infamous after making a cameo appearance in “Return of the Wererabbit” – a Wallace & Gromitt film. This cheese may smell powerfully pungent, but the flavour is rather delicate and herbaceous.
