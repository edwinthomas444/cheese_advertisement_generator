TASTING NOTES
A deliciously buttery, creamy blue cheese with a natural rind and gentle mellow flavour. The cheese has an almost ‘spreadable’ texture and lingering creaminess creating a very unctuous, rich blue.  Traditionally hand-made on Wilson Fields Farm in Lancashire from local fresh milk taken from the Butler family’s pedigree herd. The makers particularly recommend pairing this sumptuously soft cheese with a glass of Prosecco or Port.
