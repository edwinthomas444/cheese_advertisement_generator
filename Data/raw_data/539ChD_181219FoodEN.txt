Westcombe Farmhouse Cheddar
A hard-pressed cheese with a rich, buttery, lingering, deep flavour using only the milk from the three herds that are grazed on the lush Somerset pastures.
TASTING NOTES
Cheese has been made at Westcombe since the 1890′ using only the milk from the three herds that are grazed on the lush Somerset pastures within a mile of the dairy. A hard-pressed cheese with a rich, buttery, lingering, full flavour, boasting both European PDO status and the much rarer ‘Artisan Somerset Cheddar’ designation from Slow Food. This is their flagship cheese, traditionally handmade, using unadulterated fresh raw milk which is poured into the vat still warm from the cows.
