TASTING NOTES
Wild Garlic Yarg is a young, semi- firm textured cheese with a slightly crumbly, melt in the mouth texture, not dissimilar to a young Caerphilly. This handmade cheese is made from the rich, creamy milk of their own and their neighbours herd of cows and made to a recipe related to CORNISH YARG. The young cheese is handwrapped in strips of fresh wild garlic, harvested freshly from the surrounding woodlands, that impart a very subtle hint of garlic on the finish.  This cheese undergoes a slightly longer maturation than the original Yarg.  This is due to the well-known medicinal and anti-bacterial properties of garlic, which also help prevent the pace of natural mould development.  The resulting cheese is rich and creamy, with a restrained hit of garlic on the finish.
