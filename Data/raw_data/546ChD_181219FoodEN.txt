Black Bomber

Distinctively coated in black wax, Black Bomber cheddar from the Snowdonia cheese company is a delicious cheddar. Often unfairly overlooked for the likes of Quickes and Montgomery's, Black Bomber has a delicious tangy taste, with creamy texture and those lovely, crunchy cheese 'crystals'.

The wax coating helps keep the cheddar nice and moist and when left out of the fridge for a couple of hours it takes on an almost fudge like, melt-in-the-mouth texture.

This is a very popular cheese with our customers and once you've tried it you'll understand why. We quite often have customers buy a few at a time to share with friends or neighbours, especially through the summer barbecue season.

The tangy flavours and creamy texture work superbly well with IPA's and for this we'd recommend session IPA's such as Neck Oil by Beavertown Brewery.
