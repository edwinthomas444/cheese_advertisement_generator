Perl Las
Perl Las means 'blue pearl' which is fitting for a cheese of such quality. Made nearby Caws Cenarth of Cardigan in West Wales this is a blue cheese that is really hard to beat. Production of Perl Las started in 1987 as a means to diversify their farm business away from just milk. This change of direction proved to be a really success and Caws Cenarth now produce a range of magnificent Welsh cheese.

All Perl Las is handmade and rather than be dipped in brine like many other cheeses, Perl Las has local sea salt rubbed on the rind which gives a subtler saltiness than you may find with blue cheese in general. This is a good introductory cheese for those who aren't keen on blue cheese as the flavours are gentle and refined, yet satisfying with a subtle sweetness, but can grow as the cheese matures. Another pleasing element to the cheese is the light golden colour of the paste, which looks great with the blue. 

We find the sweetness quite addictive and once we start eating it's difficult to stop. Perl Las is at its best with a bit of crusty bread and possibly a bit of fig jam to compliment the light sweetness of the cheese. To drink, we'd accompany this with a sweet stout or, of course, a glass of port.

Perl Las also features in our 'Most Popular Cheese Selection' box, which is a cheese hamper of our most popular cheeses.

Perl Las is made with pasteurised milk and suitable for vegetarians.
