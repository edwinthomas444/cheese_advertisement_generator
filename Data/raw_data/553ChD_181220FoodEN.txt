Cave Aged Goat Cheddar
Winner of 'Best Goat Cheese' at the British Cheese Awards 2017.Best Goat Cheese at British Cheese Awards 2017

Cave Aged Goats Cheddar takes 3 aspects of cheese making and combines them into 1 fantastic cheese. Firstly. there's the cheddar recipe used to make the cheese giving that familiar texture and structure. Next there's the high quality goats milk used to make the cheese and finally there the maturing process in caves in Dorset which adds a final twist to the flavour.

This really is a fantastic cheese as it has the delicious flavours of goats milk but blended into a smooth cheddar texture which somehow makes the flavours smoother and more subtle and not quite as 'goaty' as say a soft goats cheese. Caves provide the ideal maturing environment for cheese as they have a near constant and perfect level of temperature and humidity.

This is great as a cheddar substitute for anyone who can't eat cheeses made with cow's milk.
