Winterdale Shaw
Winterdale Shaw is made by Robin and Carla Betts at their farm in Fairseat, Kent using milk from their family farms' cows. In production since 2006, this cheese is a multiple award winner and has even received praise from Prince Charles.

The cheese is made in small batches using unpasteurised milk and vegetarian rennet, formed into 10kg truckles and then cloth wrapped and matured for a minimum of 9 months.

In 2013, Winterdale Shaw became the UK's first carbon neutral cheese, produced using power from solar panels and ground source heat pumps and a great deal of hard work from Robin and Carla.

Clean, lemony and nutty with a long lasting tang, although not too strong, Winterdale Shaw provides excellent complex flavours that keep going.

This is a great alternative to cheddar as the texture is similar but the flavours are different, possibly due to terroir or subtleties in the cheesemaking process. This is now a staple part of our cheese counter and we look forward to delivery day when we get to crack open a whole Winterdale.

Great in a ploughmans or to give Welsh Rarebit a twist.
