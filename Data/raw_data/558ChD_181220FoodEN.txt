Pavé Cobble
What a cheese. Pavé Cobble is a soft, ewe's milk cheese that cleaned up at the 2017 British Cheese Awards, winning Best Speciality Cheese, Best Fresh Cheese, Best English Cheese and of course, the ultimate accolade, Supreme Champion.

Made by White Lake Cheeses in Somerset, Pavé Cobble follows traditional cheesemaking methods and each one is hand-ladled into a delicate pyramid shape. The cheeses are then dusted in charcoal and matured for around three weeks to produce a perfect taste and texture. As you cut into the velvety rind, you should get a soft and silky paste starting to ooze out if the cheese is at perfect maturity.

White Lake Cheeses are famous for being leaders in their field when it comes to making goats milk cheese but Pavé Cobble is proof that they are equally as skilled with ewe's milk.

This cheese is absolutely delicious and we'd recommend eating this with light crackers and a chilled glass of white wine or a light Somerset cider.
