Dorset Blue Vinny
Made on Woodbridge Farm in the heart of Dorset using milk from the farms own Friesian cows, Dorset Blue is a unique British Blue. Traditionally made using the milk left-over after the cream had been removed to make butter, Dorset Blue Vinny is lower in fat as a result.

It has a texture and taste similar to Stilton, although the former is perhaps slightly crumblier and the taste a little stronger. Dorset Blue Vinny is made using pasteurised milk and vegetarian rennet.

This is a new line for us so we're looking forward to trying out a number of taste combinations to see what it works well with. Port and slow baked figs are top of our list to test.
