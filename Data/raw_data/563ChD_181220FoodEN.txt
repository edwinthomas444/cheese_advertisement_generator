Cobblers Nibble
Cobblers Nibble is part of the new breed of English cheeses which are really boosting the artisan cheese industry in the UK. Made in Northamptonshire using pasteurised milk from a local herd of Fresian cows, Cobblers Nibble brings together some of the best aspects of traditional English cheeses and creates a new type of cheese which is simply fantastic. The work by Gary Bradshaw of Hamm Tun Fine Foods in perfecting this cheese are really to be applauded and more and more accolades are sure to follow.

Cobblers Nibble has a lovely, crumbly texture reminiscent of Cheshire or Wensleydale, but as you taste it, this gives way to a rich creaminess more akin to a soft cheese which then finishes with a long, slightly bitter blue finish. This is a hugely versatile cheese equally at home on a cheeseboard or melted on top of boiled potatoes, it also has a striking appearance with a beautifully unique rind, which comes from a secret aging process that the cheesemaker refuses to give away!

Unusually for a hard, English cheese, Cobblers Nibble pairs very well with fruity French wines, especially those with cherry flavours as the cheese really brings those to the ascendancy.

Cobblers Nibble is suitable for vegetarians.
