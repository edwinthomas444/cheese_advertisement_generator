Goddess
Made with the milk of Guernsey cows, Goddess is a fabulous and innovative cheese collaboration between Blur bassist Alex James and White Lake Cheeses of Somerset. The cheese is washed in Somerset cider brandy which gives a lovely pungency and rich, golden colour to the rind. Within the rind the cheese has a lovely fudgy texture reminiscent of Langres and a fully buttery flavour.

This is a multiple award winning cheese, winning Reserve Champion, Best Semi-soft Cheese, and a Gold Medal at the 2015 British Cheese Awards.

Very versatile when it comes to pairings. Cider is a good choice due to the flavours brought out by washing, but white wines and hoppy beers also work very well with this cheese.

It's hard to go wrong with any cheese from the 'Alex James Presents...' range.
