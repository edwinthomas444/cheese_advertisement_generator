Cornish Camembert
Handmade in Newquay, Cornish Camembert is a delicious take on the French classic, Camembert de Normandie and its smaller size makes it ideal if, for some reason you don't think you'd get through a full Camembert de Normandie.

Made with pasteurised milk, Cornish Camembert has a rich, creamy flavour and melt-in-the-mouth texture and is a great cheese to build a cheeseboard round. In fact, such is the variety of cheeses from Cornwall you could build a cheeseboard of entirely Cornish cheeses.

This cheese is suitable for vegetarians.
