Dorstone
Dorstone is an absolutely fantastic British goats cheese made by Charlie Westhead in Hertfordshire. Sold young, it's flavours are distinctly citrusy with a nice hint of goat to give a well rounded cheese. The texture is soft and creamy, which just enhances the pleasure of eating this cheese.

As well as the taste, we love the look of Dorstone cheese. It's irregular cylinder shape, wrinkly geotrichum rind and ash dusting make this a truly beautiful cheese.

We would eat this with light buttermilk crackers and a cold white wine of pale ale.
