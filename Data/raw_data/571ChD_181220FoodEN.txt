Winslade
From the makers of Tunworth, one of our favourite cheeses, Winslade is a cross between Camembert and the awesome Vacherin Mont d'Or. It's soft and gooey and it's spruce wrapping imparts flavours of pine and alpine flowers which gives it a lighter flavour than its partner Tunworth.

We love Winslade when we can squish it onto some olive bread as the saltiness of the olives works really well with the cheese. To drink we'd recommend a light lager or pilsner, or if wine is your preference then something like a Gewurtztraminer.
