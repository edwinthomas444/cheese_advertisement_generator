Kidderton Ash
As with many goats cheeses, Kidderton Ash is coated in charcoal ash to protect it as it ripens. With Kidderton, the rind of the cheese distinctively blooms through the ash as it ripens giving it a lovely grey, fluffy appearance that looks superb on a cheeseboard.

This is another great cheese from Cheshire, being made at Ravens Oak Dairy, Nantwich.

Crumble Kidderton ash over fried aubergine fritters and then drizzle honey over it all for a delicious starter. If you feel like indulging in a glass of wine to wash it down the a citrusy Sauvignon Blanc or a floral Gewurtztraminer are good matches.
