Tor
Tor cheese is a goats cheese made by White Lake in Somerset. It's visually stunning, with its distinctive truncated pyramid shape and geotrichum rind dusted with ash.

When young, Tor has a delicate, lemony taste but as it matures a more goaty tang emerges with a hint of nuttiness.

This cheese pairs well with strong white wine as well as light red wine.
