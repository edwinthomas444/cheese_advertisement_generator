Bath Soft Cheese
Bath Soft cheese is a soft, bloomy rind cheese in a neat square. Once the bloomy rind has been cut, the cheese is soft and has been known to ooze magnificently without too much encouragement. 

The cheese has a lovely mushroomy flavour with a slight citrusy tang which is not too dissimilar to Brie and is a good size that it can be the centrepiece of a cheeseboard.

The cheese is made to an original 19th century recipe and is also organic.
