Ragstone
Ragstone is a creamy, log-shaped goat's cheese, made using unpasteurised milk and traditional kid rennet, in Hertfordshire by Neals Yard Creamery.

It has a smooth and creamy texture with lovely, mellow nutty flavour that's goaty but not overpowering, although as with any cheese the flavour grows as it matures. A great British version of the French goats cheese Saint Maure although the flavours are a little different.  Despite being a big name, Neals Yard Creamery adopt a traditional approach to cheese making for Ragstone and their other cheeses with much of the power at the dairy being provided by a windmill on site.

Cut a disc onto a buttermilk cracker, savour the nuttiness of this perfectly formed goats cheese and wash down with a glass of cold Sauvignon Blanc.

Ragstone goats cheese is one of the most popular cheeses in our London cheese shop and looks fantastic on a cheeseboard.
