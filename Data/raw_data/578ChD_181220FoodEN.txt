Eve
Eve is simply a wonderful goats cheese. The soft and squidgy centre is washed in local Somerset cider brandy and then wrapped in vine leaves to hold in the brandy flavours and this also makes it a beautiful looking cheese.

The soft, almost runny centre has a full rich flavour that's not overly 'goaty' and the contrast of the green vine leaves against the white interior of the cheese make it look great on a cheeseboard too.

If you like goat's cheese then you'll love Eve.

Made with unpasteurised milk and traditional rennet.
