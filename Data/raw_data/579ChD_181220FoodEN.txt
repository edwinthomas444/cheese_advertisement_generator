Gorwydd Caerphilly
Gorwydd (pronounced Gor-with) Caerphilly is made in North Somerset by Trethowan's Dairy and is matured for at least 2 months. It's made with unpasteurised milk and traditional rennet, which is a major factor to the quality of the Caerphilly. The taste is fresh and clean with slight lemony notes, which work wonderfully with the creamy and slightly springy texture.

Caerphilly cheese was originally a small farm cheese made for farmhands and miners in and around the town of Caerphilly, Wales. However, for various reasons the production of Caerphilly in Wales practically died out during the 19th century, although cheesemakers in Somerset started making it as they could get a return on their milk sooner as Caerphilly doesn't need as long to mature as Cheddar.

Gorwydd Caerphilly was made in Wales from around 20 years until production was moved to Somerset in 2014.

It’s very easy to enjoy Gorwydd Caerphilly on its own or with simple crackers, but we've been playing about with it somewhat and enjoy it in a toastie along with roasted leeks and English mustard.
