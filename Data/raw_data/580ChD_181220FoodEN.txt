Wyfe of Bath

The Wyfe of Bath is one of a kind - mellow, sweet, nutty flavours with a lingering, creamy finish. There are so many things to like about this cheese. It's organic, hand made, the milk used to make it is from a single herd and all these things combine to make a truly wonderful cheese. The terroir really contributes to the cheese and you can taste and see subtle differences to the cheese as the seasons change.

The Wyfe of Bath is loosely based on a Gouda recipe but the taste and texture of the resulting cheese is markedly different. 

If ever a cheese reminded us of Spring it's this one with its fresh clean taste and this may just be the ideal picnic cheese. Delicious with a rose wine or American pale ale and partners well with cured meats, especially some of the more flavoursome British salami on the market today.

This cheese is suitable to eat during pregnancy.
