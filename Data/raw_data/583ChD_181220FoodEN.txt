Pendragon
Pendragon by the Somerset Cheese Company is a lovely hard buffalo milk cheese with subtle, nutty flavours and a salty, creamy finish. One of our core range of cheeses, we can't recommend it highly enough as an addition to your cheese board. Pendragon has a similar texture to cheddar, although slightly less firm.

Cheese made with buffalo milk has a lovely colour and light creamy flavour for the most part and Pendragon is no exception. It's one of a number of fantastic cheeses produced by the Somerset Cheese Company and a beautifully innovative cheese.

We enjoy Pendragon with a light, floral wine, either red or white if light enough not to overpower the cheese. If you prefer beer then a light pale ale is suitable or even a sparkling cider such as Charrington's.

Pendragon buffalo milk cheese is suitable for vegetarians.
