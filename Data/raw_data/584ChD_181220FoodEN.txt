Montgomery's Cheddar
Montgomery's Cheddar is a perfect example of a classic British Cheddar. This one is matured to perfection for 12 months, although some go for 18 months, giving rise to complex, nutty flavours that make this such a great cheddar. 

At Manor Farm, the home of Montgomery's Cheddar, cheese is made seven days a week to ensure the freshness of the milk and thus the quality of the cheese. The milk comes from the farm's own herd of Friesian cows.

Great in a ploughman's or just to nibble on, it's hard to see past Monty's when you're looking for a cheddar. Wash it down with a hoppy IPA.
