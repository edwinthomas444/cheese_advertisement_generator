The Truffler
The Truffler Cornish Brie is something special, it's a mould ripened soft cheese infused with truffle oil. The Truffler has a delicious, earthy, Brie-style taste but the subtle tones of the truffle come through and work well with the mushroomy rind. Really delicious and well worth a try.

This is great for a spring/summer picnic as the flavours works so well with the relaxed atmosphere of summer meadows and fun in the sun.
