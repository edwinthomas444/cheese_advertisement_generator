Cashel Blue
Cashel Blue is a unique blue cheese from County Tipperary in Ireland. While not strong as such, Cashel Blue has a well balanced blue flavour even when matured up to 6 months. Its gentle creaminess grows into a slightly spicy, salty blue with lovely blue flavour.

Cashel Blue cheese has won more awards than we have room to list here and every single one of them is deserved. We think you'll love this cheese whichever way you choose to eat it but try pairing it with a hoppy IPA for a slightly different combination but strong Belgian beers also work very well. 

It's also a fantastic cheese for cooking with and we often use it in our cafe, Froth & Rind in a toastie with fig jam. It's also great melted on a steak and Amelia's Ices do a great Cashel Blue and port ice cream that has to be tasted to be believed.
