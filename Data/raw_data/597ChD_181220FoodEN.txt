Hawes Wensleydale
The limestone soil in Yorkshire impacts the flavour of the cheese adding to its gentle flavour, which is balanced by a slightly tart freshness. Hawes Wensleydale has deeper more complex flavours than most Wensleydales and is a more mature, drier cheese. It is also one of the only versions made using the traditional, cloth-bound method.
