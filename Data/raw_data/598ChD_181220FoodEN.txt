Beenleigh Blue
This is an unusual ewe's milk blue cheese made near Totnes in Devon. It is unlike any other British blue cheese: crumbly and moist with a rich, complex and herbaceous yet sweet flavour with hints of grass and flowers from the ewe's milk and savouriness from the blue veining.

Pair with cider from Devon.
