1) Description of Cheese:
Dovedale, produced by a renowned British cheese manufacturer, is a sumptuous, creamy soft blue cheese. It has a rich history and comes from the picturesque Dovedale Valley in England.

2) Description of Product:
This cheese has a distinctive continental appearance and flavour, thanks to its unique preparation process. It is round in shape, with a creamy texture and a mild blue flavour. The cheese is coated with a brine dip, which adds a perfect balance of saltiness to its taste. It weighs approximately 200 grams and is made from high-quality cow's milk, using traditional rennet.

3) Description of Process:
Unlike most British cheeses that are dry salted, Dovedale undergoes a special brine dipping process, which gives it its unique taste and appearance. After being formed into rounds, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 8 weeks, allowing it to develop its creamy texture and distinct blue flavour.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Dovedale has a pleasant, creamy aroma with a hint of saltiness. Its taste is mild and creamy, with a subtle tanginess from the blue veins. The brine dipping process adds a perfect balance of saltiness, making it a delight for cheese lovers.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully enjoy the flavours of Dovedale, it is best served at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese platter, accompanied by crackers, grapes, and figs. This versatile cheese pairs well with a variety of foods, such as salads, sandwiches, or even melted on top of a burger. For a perfect wine pairing, we recommend a light-bodied red wine, such as Pinot Noir or a crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc.

6) Quality Assurance:
Dovedale has received numerous accolades, including the prestigious Great Taste Award, for its exceptional taste and quality. It has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure that every bite is of the highest standard.
