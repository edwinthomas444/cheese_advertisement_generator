Introducing Swaledale Blue Cheese, a natural rind cheese from the renowned Reed family in Richmond, Yorkshire. This cheese has a rich history, dating back to the 11th century when it was first made by Cistercian monks who settled in the local abbeys. Today, the Swaledale recipe and methods are protected with PDO status, ensuring the highest quality for this cherished treasure.

2) Description of Product:
Swaledale Blue Cheese is a hard pressed yet moist cow's milk cheese, handmade in the traditional farmhouse style. It features a creamy color with distinctive blue veins running throughout, and has a soft, moist open texture. The cheese weighs approximately 2.3Kg and is available in the traditional natural rind.

3) Description of Process:
The Swaledale Blue Cheese is made using locally sourced milk and vegetarian rennet. After the milk is pressed and shaped, it is then aged for 4-6 weeks, allowing for the perfect balance of flavors to develop. This careful process results in a cheese that is both creamy and tangy, with a smooth nutty flavor.
