1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing the award-winning ﻿Swaledale Ewe Cheese PDO, handcrafted by the Reed family in Richmond, Yorkshire. This beloved cheese has a rich history dating back to the 11th century, when Cistercian monks brought cheese-making techniques from Normandy to the Yorkshire dales. Today, the Swaledale recipe and methods are protected with PDO status, ensuring the highest quality and authenticity.

2) Description of Product:
Our Swaledale Ewe Cheese PDO is a hard-pressed, yet moist, cheese made from locally sourced ewe's milk and vegetarian rennet. Each wheel is coated in black wax and weighs approximately 2.5kg, making it the perfect size for sharing with friends and family. Its soft, open texture and slight tang make it a unique and delicious addition to any cheese board.

3) Description of Process:
Our cheese-making process begins with the arrival of spring and the start of lambing season. The milk from our happy, grass-fed ewes is carefully handcrafted into cheese using traditional methods passed down through generations. The cheese is then aged for 4-6 weeks, allowing its flavors to develop and mature.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening the wax coating, you'll be greeted with a subtle, yet inviting aroma. The Swaledale Ewe Cheese PDO has a mild and smooth taste, with a slight tang that perfectly complements its soft, moist texture. Its unique flavor profile is a result of the high-quality milk and time-honored techniques used in its production.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the ultimate cheese experience, we recommend serving our Swaledale Ewe Cheese PDO at room temperature. Its beautiful black wax coating makes for an impressive presentation on any cheese board. Pair it with a dry Champagne for a heavenly combination, or use it in cooking for a delicious Ewe cheese and spinach soufflé.

6) Quality Assurance:
Our commitment to quality has not gone unnoticed. The Swaledale Ewe Cheese PDO has received numerous awards and accolades, including recognition from the prestigious Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. This guarantees the authenticity and quality of our cheese, ensuring that every bite is a taste of the Yorkshire dales. As our satisfied customers say, "This is one of the dales' most cherished treasures."
