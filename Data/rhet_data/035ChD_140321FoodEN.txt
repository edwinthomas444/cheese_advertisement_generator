1) Description of Cheese:
Cornish Yarg is a delicious semi-hard cheese that has been enjoyed for many years. It is produced by the Horrells, who discovered the recipe from a Cornish dairy farmer named Gray. The name Yarg was chosen as a nod to the former owner, with a reversed spelling. Hailing from Cornwall, this cheese has a rich historical and geographical provenance that adds to its unique character.

2) Description of Product:
This unique cheese follows a Wensleydale style recipe, but with its own distinct differences. It has a smaller size compared to traditional Wensleydale, and is wrapped in nettle leaves after being pressed. A light spray of penicillium candidum white mould is then added, giving the cheese its signature appearance and flavor. Made from high-quality milk and using rennet, Cornish Yarg is a true artisanal cheese.

3) Description of Process:
Cornish Yarg is made with great care and attention to detail. The cheese is prepared using a traditional Wensleydale recipe, but with the addition of nettle leaves and white mould. It is then aged to perfection, allowing the flavors to develop and mature. This process gives Cornish Yarg its unique taste and texture.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening the package, you will be greeted with a delightful aroma that is both fresh and slightly tangy. The creamy texture of the cheese is complemented by the crumbly core, creating a perfect balance of flavors. The nettle leaves and white mould add a distinct dimension to the cheese, making it a truly one-of-a-kind experience.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Cornish Yarg at room temperature. This allows the flavors to fully develop and enhances the creamy texture. When presenting this cheese, the nettle leaves and white mould make for a stunning visual display.
