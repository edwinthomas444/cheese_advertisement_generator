1) Description of Cheese:
Derby, produced by traditional British hard cheese manufacturers such as Belton Farm, Joseph Heler, and Reeces of Malpas, has a rich historical and geographical provenance. It originated in the village of Longford in Derbyshire, where the first creamery in the UK was set up by a group of farmers. These farmers agreed to pool their milk and use techniques developed in the USA to produce a larger scale of this cheese.

2) Description of Product:
Derby is a drum-shaped cheese with a softer body compared to its famous cousins, Cheddar and Cheshire. It has a slightly higher moisture content, giving it a springy and mild texture when young. The cheese is made from cow's milk and uses rennet during the production process.

3) Description of the Process:
The preparation of Derby involves a unique process where it does not go through the traditional Cheddaring process. Instead, it is aged to develop subtle sweet flavors and a firmer texture. This cheese is aged for a shorter period compared to other hard cheeses, making it perfect for those who prefer a milder taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Derby has a distinct aroma that is both creamy and slightly tangy. The taste is initially mild and springy, but as it matures, it develops subtle sweet flavors and a firmer texture. This cheese is perfect for those who enjoy a balance of mild and bold flavors.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Derby at room temperature to bring out its full flavor. It can be presented on a cheese board or paired with crackers, fruits, and nuts. This cheese pairs well with a variety of wines, including Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon.

6) Quality Assurance:
Fowlers Forest Dairy in Warwickshire is one of the few producers of traditional drum-shaped Derby cheese. They have been making cheese for generations, with roots tracing back to the 16th century in Derbyshire. This cheese has also received numerous awards and accolades, solidifying its reputation as a high-quality and delicious cheese. As quoted by cheese experts, "Derby is a must-try for all cheese lovers."
