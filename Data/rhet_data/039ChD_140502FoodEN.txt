1) Description of Cheese:
Experience the rich history and unique flavor of Red Leicester cheese, formerly known as "Leicestershire Cheese". Originating in the county of Leicestershire in England, this cheese has been enjoyed since the 17th century. Today, it is proudly produced by Tuxford & Tebbutt, Long Clawson Dairy, and Quenby Hall – all renowned for their traditional cheese-making methods.

2) Description of Product:
Our Red Leicester cheese is a hard-pressed, russet red cheese that comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from 3 to 12 months of age. Made from the highest quality cow's milk and rennet, this cheese boasts a unique coating of annatto – a vegetable dye derived from the husk of the fruit of the annatto tree found in South America and the Caribbean.

3) Description of Process:
Our cheese-making process is rooted in tradition, with influences from other regions of England. The milk, sourced from cows grazing on lush pastures, is carefully selected and crafted into a flat wheel shape. It is then aged to perfection, resulting in a firm yet friable texture and a slightly sweet, mellow flavor that becomes stronger with age.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening a package of Red Leicester cheese, you will be greeted with a rich, savory aroma. The taste is equally delightful, with complex flavors that range from sweet to tangy. As the cheese ages, the flavors become more pronounced, making each bite a truly unique experience.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For optimal flavor, we recommend serving Red Leicester cheese at room temperature. Its vibrant color makes it a beautiful addition to any cheeseboard, and it pairs perfectly with a variety of foods – from salads to sauces. For a truly indulgent experience, try pairing it with a glass of your favorite wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Don't just take our word for it – Red Leicester cheese has received numerous accolades and awards, including the prestigious Quality Standard Mark from the British Cheese Board. Our cheese also undergoes rigorous quality testing to ensure that every bite is of the highest quality. As one satisfied customer put it, "This cheese is worth every penny!"
