1) Description of Cheese:
Dorset Blue, produced by a small cheesemaking company in Dorset, is a Protected Food Name with a rich historical and geographical provenance. This cheese is a close relative of Dorset Blue Vinney and is known for its unique and distinctive flavor.

2) Description of Product:
Dorset Blue is a cylindrical-shaped cheese with a uniform color and irregular blue/green veins. It is similar in size to Blue Stilton and Blue Wensleydale and has a weight that varies with age. Made from partially skimmed, heat treated milk, this cheese is crafted with the finest ingredients and uses traditional rennet for a truly authentic taste.

3) Description of Process:
The process of creating Dorset Blue is a labor of love. After forming the curds and draining them overnight, the cheese is cut into blocks and stacked, turning every 20-30 minutes. The curds are then milled, salted, and put into cylindrical molds where they are lightly pressed. After 4 days, the mold is removed and the cheese is rubbed to form a crust. At 4 weeks, the cheese is skewered to allow air to enter and form the blue veins. It is then aged for 8 to 16 weeks, resulting in a harder texture and stronger flavors.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Dorset Blue is known for its peppery, spicy flavor that varies with age. Its aroma is rich and earthy, with hints of the traditional cheesemaking process. As a reduced fat blue cheese, it tends to be harder than other blue cheeses, making it a unique and delicious option for any cheese lover.
