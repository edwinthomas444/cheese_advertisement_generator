1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Whitehaven, a delicious creation from Raven's Oak Dairy in Nantwich. This cheese is made from locally produced goat's milk, giving it a unique taste and texture. Nantwich, a town in Cheshire, England, has a rich history in cheese-making, making Whitehaven a true representation of its geographical provenance.

2) Description of Product:
Whitehaven is a white mould soft cheese, shaped into a round wheel and coated with a thin layer of brine salt. Each wheel weighs approximately 200 grams and is made using traditional methods, with the addition of rennet to help coagulate the goat's milk.

3) Description of Process:
To create Whitehaven, the goat's milk is first brine-salted and then sprayed with penicillium candidum white mould. This gives the cheese its signature white exterior and helps to develop its unique flavor. The curd, which is naturally white, softens as it ripens from the outside in, resulting in a creamy and smooth texture.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Whitehaven has a mild and delicate flavor, with subtle hints of goat's milk that can only be detected by those with a refined palate. Its aroma is equally delicate, with a slight tanginess that adds to its overall appeal. This cheese is perfect for those who prefer a more subtle taste in their cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Whitehaven at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. When presenting this cheese, we recommend cutting it into thin wedges and arranging them on a platter with crackers and fresh fruits. Whitehaven pairs well with a variety of foods, including salads, sandwiches, and even desserts. For a complete indulgence, we suggest pairing it with a crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.
