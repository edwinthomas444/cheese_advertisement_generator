For the best experience, we recommend serving Ardrahan at room temperature. Its full texture and flavor is best enjoyed when paired with a selection of Irish cheeses such as Cashel Blue, St Killian, and Carrigaline. Add some soda bread or oat cakes to complete your cheeseboard. For wine lovers, Ardrahan pairs beautifully with a crisp white wine or a full-bodied red.
