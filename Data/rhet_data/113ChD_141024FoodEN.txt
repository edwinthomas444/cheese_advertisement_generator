1) Description of Cheese: Beaufort, manufactured in France, is a full fat hard cheese made from unpasteurised cow's milk. It is known as 'the prince of Gruyères' and has a rich history dating back to the 14th century. It is exclusively produced in the Savoie region of the French Alps, using traditional methods passed down through generations.

2) Description of Product: Beaufort has a distinctive wheel shape, weighing approximately 40kg, with a natural rind and a pale yellow interior. It boasts a smooth, creamy, and buttery texture, thanks to the use of raw milk and a specific type of rennet. This cheese is a true representation of the terroir, with the cows grazing on the alpine pastures of the Savoie region, giving it a unique and delicious flavor.

3) Description of Process: The process of making Beaufort is a labor of love, involving handcrafted techniques that have been perfected over centuries. The milk is heated and then mixed with rennet, which coagulates the milk and forms curds. The curds are then pressed into molds and aged for a minimum of 5 months in cellars, where they are regularly turned and brushed with brine to develop its distinct flavor and texture.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Beaufort has a fruity aroma with a hint of nuttiness, which intensifies as it ages. The taste is rich and complex, with notes of caramel and a slight tanginess. The texture is smooth and creamy, with a slight crunch from the natural crystals that form during the aging process.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, remove Beaufort from the fridge an hour before serving to allow it to reach room temperature and fully develop its flavor. It is perfect for a cheeseboard, where it can be presented in its beautiful wheel shape. It also melts beautifully, making it an excellent addition to cooked dishes or sprinkled over the top. Pair it with a crusty baguette, dried fruits, and nuts for a delicious snack. For a complete experience, pair it with a full-bodied red wine, such as a Bordeaux or a Syrah.

6) Quality Assurance: Beaufort has received numerous accolades, including the prestigious AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) certification, which guarantees its authenticity and quality. It has also won several awards, including the gold medal at the Concours Général Agricole in Paris. The cheese undergoes strict quality tests to ensure that it meets the highest standards, making it a must-try for all cheese lovers. As one satisfied customer put it, "Beaufort is a cheese that transcends all others."
