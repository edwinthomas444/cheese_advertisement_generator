1) Description of Cheese: Introducing Cornish Yarg, a delicious semi-hard cheese made from cow's milk by the skilled cheese-makers of Cornwall. This cheese is named after its creators, Gray spelled backwards, and has a rich history dating back to the early days of cheese-making in England.

2) Description of Product: Cornish Yarg is a semi-hard cheese with a mild flavor and a slight citrus tang. It has a moist and supple texture and is coated with nettles, giving it a subtle yet unique flavor. The creamy white interior is contrasted by the green nettles, making it a visually appealing addition to any cheeseboard. This cheese is made from pasteurized milk and uses vegetarian rennet, making it suitable for vegetarians.

3) Description of Process: Cornish Yarg is carefully prepared by hand, following traditional cheese-making techniques. It is then aged to perfection, allowing its flavors to develop and mature. During this process, a natural greyish mold may develop on the nettles, adding to the complexity of its flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The aroma of Cornish Yarg is delicate and inviting, with hints of citrus and earthy notes. The taste is equally delightful, with a creamy and slightly tangy flavor that is balanced by the subtle herbaceous notes from the nettles.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Cornish Yarg at room temperature by taking it out of the fridge an hour before serving. It pairs perfectly with a selection of other British cheeses on a cheeseboard. You can also slice it and serve it with warm bread, sliced apple or pear, and a fruity chutney for a delicious snack or appetizer. For a complete dining experience, pair Cornish Yarg with a crisp white wine or a light red wine.
