1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Cremet, the award-winning goat's milk cheese from Sharpham Wine & Cheese in Devon, England. This soft, artisan cheese is a recent addition to the Sharpham line, officially launched in 2013.

2) Description of Product:
Cremet is a double cream experience, made from unpasteurized cow's and goat's milk and enriched with cows' cream. It is a soft-ripened cheese with a bloomy rind, creamy and smooth texture, and a weight of approximately 8 ounces.

3) Description of Process:
Crafted with care, Cremet is prepared using traditional methods and aged to perfection. The result is a delicate and subtle cheese when young, which develops into a rich and earthy flavor as it matures.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
When you open a wheel of Cremet, you'll be greeted with a fresh and rich aroma. The cheese itself boasts a creamy and lemony flavor, with a hint of tanginess from the goat's milk.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Cremet at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. Its white, bloomy rind and smooth texture make for a beautiful presentation on any cheese board. Pair it with fresh fruits, crackers, and a glass of crisp white wine for a perfect combination.

6) Quality Assurance:
Cremet has received numerous awards, including gold at World Cheese Awards 2013, silver at British Cheese Awards 2014, and bronze at Taste of the West Awards 2014. But don't just take our word for it, try it for yourself and taste the excellence of this artisan cheese. As one satisfied customer put it, "Cremet is a true delight for the senses."
