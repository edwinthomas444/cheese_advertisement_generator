1) Description of Cheese: Ticklemore is a delicious, award-winning cheese made from pasteurized goat's milk. It is produced in Devon, southwest England by two renowned producers, Neal's Yard Dairy and Sharpham Wine & Cheese. The cheese has a rich history, originally invented by Robin Congdon of Ticklemore Dairy and later perfected by Mark Sharman at Sharpham Creamery.

2) Description of Product: Ticklemore is a semi-hard, artisan cheese with a unique shape and texture. It is hand-pressed into a basket mould and shaped into a flattened sphere, resembling a flying saucer. The cheese has a crumbly centre and a snowy white, natural rind. Each wheel weighs approximately 200 grams and is made with vegetarian rennet.

3) Description of Process: Ticklemore cheese is carefully prepared using traditional methods and aged to perfection. The goat's milk is pasteurized before being pressed into the basket mould. The cheese is then aged for several weeks, allowing the flavors to develop and the texture to become firm and open.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Ticklemore cheese has a delightful aroma, with floral and grassy notes that are mild and fresh. The flavors are complex, with hints of grass, mushrooms, and a subtle lemony tang. The cheese has a clean and rich taste, without the overpowering aroma of other goat's cheeses.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best taste experience, we recommend serving Ticklemore cheese at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board, sliced or crumbled, and paired with a variety of foods. Ticklemore pairs well with fresh fruits, crackers, and artisanal bread. For a complete sensory experience, we suggest pairing it with a crisp white wine.

6) Quality Assurance: Ticklemore cheese has been recognized for its exceptional quality, winning gold at the British Cheese Awards 2014, Taste of the West 2014, and Global Cheese Awards 2013. It has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure its safety and delicious taste. As one satisfied customer put it, "Ticklemore cheese is a must-try for all cheese lovers!"
