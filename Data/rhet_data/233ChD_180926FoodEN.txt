1) Description of Cheese: Dorstone by Neal's Yard Dairy is a delicious, artisanal cheese made from unpasteurized goat's milk. It is named after the picturesque village of Dorstone in Herefordshire, England, where it is produced by expert cheesemakers Charlie Westhead and Haydn Roberts at Neal Yard's Creamery.

2) Description of Product: This soft, surface-ripened cheese has a creamy and fluffy texture, with a mold-ripened rind and a white color. It is available in a variety of sizes and weights, and is coated in charcoal powder for a unique and distinctive appearance. The cheese is made using animal rennet, giving it a rich and authentic flavor.

3) Description of Process: Dorstone cheese is carefully crafted using traditional methods, with the curds being transferred to molds and aged for 2-3 weeks. During this time, the cheese develops a mousse-like texture and a wrinkled, blue/grey rind scattered with white, downy mold called Geotrichum. This unique aging process gives the cheese its lemony-fresh flavor and a hint of vegetabley-ness.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The aroma of Dorstone cheese is aromatic and enticing, with a savory and nutty edge from the moldy rind. When ready to eat, it has a tangy and full-flavored taste, with hints of citrus, saltiness, and sweetness. The creamy and fluffy texture adds to the overall sensory experience of this delicious cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Dorstone cheese at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers, fruits, and nuts, or used in recipes such as salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes. This versatile cheese pairs well with a variety of wines, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Noir, and complements a range of foods, including fresh fruits, cured meats, and honey.
