1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Gloucester, a traditional, full fat, hard cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised cowsâ€™ milk. Produced by Smart's Farm in Gloucestershire, England, this cheese has a rich history dating back to 1498 in the City of Gloucester. Made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, this cheese is a testament to the region's heritage and dedication to preserving traditional cheese-making methods.

2) Description of Product:
Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties, with each offering a unique taste and texture experience. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, while Double Gloucester uses full fat milk, resulting in a richer and more flavorful cheese. The double variety is also twice the height of the single and has a smooth, buttery texture and apricot color thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Both varieties use vegetarian rennet and are available in a range of sizes and weights.

3) Description of Process:
The cheese-making process for Gloucester is a labor of love, with each batch carefully crafted using traditional methods. The milk is first pasteurized or left unpasteurized, before being skimmed or left full fat depending on the variety being made. The curds are then formed, pressed, and aged for a minimum of 4 months. This aging process results in a cheese with a complex and nutty flavor, perfect for any cheese lover.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Gloucester has a distinctive aroma of fresh grass and sweetness, thanks to the high-quality milk used in its production. The taste is acidic, grassy, and slightly nutty, with a hint of sweetness. The single variety has a lighter, more crumbly texture, while the double is smoother and denser.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Gloucester at room temperature to allow its full flavor to develop. It can be served on a cheese board or grated over dishes for added richness. Pair this cheese with traditional British ale or a bold red wine like Syrah for a perfect balance of flavors.

6) Quality Assurance:
Gloucester has received numerous accolades, including a PDO designation for the single variety, meaning it can only be produced in Gloucestershire. It has also been awarded at the annual Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. With its rich history, traditional production methods, and exceptional taste, Gloucester is a cheese that is sure to impress.
