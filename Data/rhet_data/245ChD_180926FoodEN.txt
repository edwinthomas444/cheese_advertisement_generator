1) Description of Cheese:
Golden Cross is a soft, artisan, log-shaped cheese made by the Golden Cross Cheese Company Ltd. It has its roots in the beautiful countryside of East Sussex, England and is proudly handcrafted by Kevin and Alison Blunt at their farm in Whitesmith. The name of the cheese is inspired by a golden cross on the roof of a local village pub, adding a touch of history and tradition to this delicious cheese.

2) Description of Product:
This vegetarian cheese is made from unpasteurized goat's milk, giving it a unique and rich flavor. It is a soft-ripened cheese with a bloomy white rind and a creamy, dense and firm texture. Each log is lightly charcoaled before the rind develops, adding a hint of smokiness. With a fat content of 50%, this cheese is a perfect balance of richness and creaminess.

3) Description of Process:
Golden Cross is carefully prepared and aged to perfection. The goat's milk is collected from the farm and transformed into curds using traditional methods. The cheese is then aged in a controlled environment, allowing it to develop its distinct flavor and texture. The result is a cheese that is full-flavored and bursting with freshness.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The aroma of Golden Cross is floral, fresh and grassy, reflecting the natural environment in which the goats are raised. The taste ranges from subtle and delicate to more complex and intense as the cheese matures. The creamy texture and full-flavored taste make it a favorite among cheese lovers.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Golden Cross at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board, sliced and served with crackers or bread. It also pairs perfectly with sparkling wine, such as Chapel Down Brut. For a more indulgent treat, try grilling the cheese for a warm and gooey delight.

6) Quality Assurance:
Golden Cross has received numerous accolades, including quotations from renowned chefs and awards for its exceptional quality. The cheese has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure that each bite is a delight to the taste buds. Don't miss the opportunity to try this award-winning cheese and experience the taste of East Sussex in every bite.
