1) Description of Cheese: Lincolnshire Poacher, handmade by Simon Jones in Lincolnshire, England. This award-winning cheese has a rich history and is made on a dairy farm in the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds.

2) Description of Product: This hard cheese is made from unpasteurized cow's milk and has a fat content of 45%. It is available in a cylindrical shape with a natural rind resembling granite. The cheese weighs between 12-24 months to develop a golden, straw-coloured yellow pate and spotted brown and gray colour rind.

3) Description of Process: The cheese is made using traditional methods similar to West Country Cheddar. The unpasteurized cow's milk is turned into cheese by Simon Jones himself, using milk from his herd of Holsteins. The slow-maturing process takes between 12-24 months, resulting in a smooth texture and strong taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Lincolnshire Poacher has a fruity, nutty, savory, and sweet flavor with a grassy aroma. The taste varies daily and seasonally, with notes of pineapple, toasted nuts, and grass in the summer, and a savory, meaty taste in the winter.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Lincolnshire Poacher at room temperature and present it on a cheese board with crackers, fruits, and nuts. This cheese pairs well with full-bodied red and white wines, as well as beer.

6) Quality Assurance: "Lincolnshire Poacher is an award-winning cheese" (The Guardian). It has also been described as having "both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities" (The Telegraph). The company also produces other traditional cheeses such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel, and Lincolnshire Red, all made using vegetarian rennet.
