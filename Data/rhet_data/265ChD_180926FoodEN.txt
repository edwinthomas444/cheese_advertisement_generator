1) Description of Cheese: Lord of the Hundreds by Traditional Cheese Dairy, made in East Sussex, United Kingdom. Named after Saxon times when tax collectors worked for Lords.

2) Description of Product: This semi-hard, artisan cheese is made from unpasteurized sheep's milk and has a square shape. It has a firm, grainy and open texture, with a natural golden yellow rind. Each wheel weighs approximately 4.5kg.

3) Description of Process: Lord of the Hundreds is made by hand using traditional methods. The milk is not pressed before being ladled into baskets, giving it its unique open texture. It is then aged for 6-8 months, with regular rubbing and turning to create a light grey rind.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The cheese has a distinct aroma of fresh grass and a hint of sweetness. Its flavor is a perfect balance of burnt caramel, nutty and savory notes, with a touch of sweetness. The texture is dry and slightly grainy, adding to its complexity.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best taste experience, serve Lord of the Hundreds at room temperature. It can be presented as a centerpiece on a cheese platter, or grated over dishes as a substitute for Parmigiano-Reggiano. This cheese pairs well with medium-bodied Pinot Noir or Cream Ale, enhancing its sweet and savory flavors.

6) Quality Assurance: Lord of the Hundreds has been recognized for its exceptional quality, winning multiple awards including a Gold medal in 2011 and a Silver medal in 2012 at The British Cheese Awards. It also received a Bronze medal at the World Cheese Awards in 2014. As quoted by cheese expert John Farrand, "This cheese is a true artisan gem, showcasing the best of British cheese-making."
