1) Description of Cheese: Sleightlett is a unique and delicious cheese made by Mary Holbrook on her Sleight Farm in Timsbury, Somerset, England. With a history dating back to the 1980s, this cheese has been perfected over the years and is now produced in collaboration with Neal's Yard Dairy.

2) Description of Product: Sleightlett is a fresh, soft cheese made from unpasteurized goat's milk. It is handcrafted in small batches, resulting in a creamy, fluffy and smooth texture. The cheese is shaped into small rounds and coated with a thin layer of mold. Each round weighs approximately 100 grams and is made using very little rennet, ensuring a delicate and unique flavor.

3) Description of the Process: The cheese making process for Sleightlett is meticulous and carefully monitored. The curds are gently ladled into molds and left to rest for just two to three days. After being taken out of the molds, the cheese is turned and salted, sprinkled with charcoal ash, and left to ripen for a short period of time. This allows for the perfect balance of flavors and the development of a beautiful white mold coating.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Sleightlett has a distinctive aroma of goat's milk, with a hint of lactic notes. On the palate, it offers a burst of citrusy and lemony flavors, with a subtle nuttiness that lingers in the mouth. The ash coating adds a unique touch to the cheese, making it a visually stunning and flavorful experience.

5) Serving Suggestions: To fully enjoy the flavors and textures of Sleightlett, it is best served at room temperature. Simply remove it from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board, sliced or spread on crackers. It pairs well with fresh fruits, nuts, and honey. For a complete experience, pair it with a crisp white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or a light red wine like Pinot Noir.

6) Quality Assurance: "Sleightlett is a cheese that is made with love and passion, using the highest quality ingredients and traditional methods," says Mary Holbrook. This dedication to quality has been recognized with numerous awards, including the prestigious World Cheese Awards. Each batch of Sleightlett undergoes rigorous quality tests to ensure that every bite is as delicious as the last.
