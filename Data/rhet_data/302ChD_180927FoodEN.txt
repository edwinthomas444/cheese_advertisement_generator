1) Description of Cheese: Our Cave-Aged Cheddar is a premium cheese crafted by hand at the Ashley Chase Estate in the British Isles. This estate is located between the rugged World Heritage Coastline and the Dorset Downs, providing the perfect environment for producing exceptional cheese. The milk used to make this cheese comes from the estate's own herds or from local Dorset farms within a 30-mile radius, ensuring a strict local provenance and earning it the coveted PDO status of West Country Farmhouse Cheddar.

2) Description of Product: Our Cave-Aged Cheddar is a hard cheese with a distinct shape and size, wrapped in cloth and made from pasteurized cow's milk. Each cheese is crafted with care, using microbial rennet and starter culture to create a depth of flavor and a moist texture. With a weight of 100g per serving, this cheese is perfect for sharing with friends and family.

3) Description of the Process: Our Cave-Aged Cheddar goes through a meticulous preparation process, including cutting, stacking, and turning of the curds, also known as "cheddaring". The young cheeses are then bandaged in cloth and moved to the maturing rooms. Here, they are aged in the famous Wookey Hole Caves in Somerset, which provide the perfect temperature and humidity for maintaining the balance of moisture in the cheese. This unique environment also adds a typical earthiness to the flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Upon opening, our Cave-Aged Cheddar delights the senses with its fruity and tangy aroma. The rich, deep flavor has a hint of sweetness that balances out the earthiness from the aging process. The texture is moist and creamy, making it a truly indulgent cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve our Cave-Aged Cheddar at a temperature below 8Â°. When presenting this cheese, be sure to showcase its unique shape and cloth-wrapped exterior. It pairs perfectly with crackers and fruits, and can also be used in cooking to add a depth of flavor to dishes. For a complete sensory experience, pair with a full-bodied red wine.

It has been quoted as "the best cheddar in the British Isles" and has won numerous awards for its exceptional taste and quality. Each batch is carefully tested to ensure consistency and excellence, making it a top choice for cheese connoisseurs.
