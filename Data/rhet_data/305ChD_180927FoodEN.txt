1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Kirkham's Lancashire, a traditional, creamy, and unpasteurised cheese from the British Isles. Made by Graham Kirkham in Goosnargh, Lancashire, this cheese has a rich history and geographical provenance that adds to its unique and delicious flavor.

2) Description of Product:
Kirkham's Lancashire is a hard cheese with a wonderfully moist, pressed texture. It is made from raw cow's milk, salt, starter, animal rennet, and butter, giving it a mellow tang. Each piece is freshly cut and wrapped to order, ensuring the highest quality and freshness. The cheese is available in various shapes and sizes, with a weight of approximately 100g per piece.

3) Description of the Process:
The cheese-making process for Kirkham's Lancashire takes three days, using a third of the curd from each day. This traditional method, passed down through three generations, produces a rich and complex flavor. The cheese is then cloth-bound and rubbed with butter, allowing it to mature for two to six months.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The unpasteurised milk and buttered muslin rind of Kirkham's Lancashire create a rich and complex white cheese with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. It has a clean and lactic flavor with a desired "buttery crumble." The cheese may also contain naturally occurring blue veins, adding to its character and taste.

5) Serving Suggestions:
