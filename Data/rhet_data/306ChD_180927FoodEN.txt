Introducing Montgomery's Cheddar, a traditional, cloth-wrapped, unpasteurised cheese made in Somerset by Jamie Montgomery. This cheese has been crafted with skill and care by the Montgomery family for three generations, dating back to 1911. It has gained a huge reputation for its nutty, complex flavor and is one of the last remaining traditional unpasteurized artisan Somerset Cheddars.

2) Description of Product:
Montgomery's Cheddar is a hard cheese with a golden and glorious appearance. It is made from unpasteurized cows' milk, salt, rennet, starter bacteria, and is coated in lard. Each piece is freshly cut and wrapped to order, ensuring the highest quality and freshness. It comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, with a slightly crumbly texture and small fissures throughout the cheese, giving it a unique character.

3) Description of the Process:
The cheese-making process at Montgomery's is a labor of love. Each batch is made in small quantities, seven days a week, using a traditional 'pint starter' to set the curd. This method may be more difficult, but it adds great character and complexity to the cheese. The cheese is then aged in cloth and stripped after a long maturing process, resulting in a rich, nutty, and sweet flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Montgomery's Cheddar has a distinct smell and taste that is sure to please any cheese lover. The aroma is rich and nutty, with hints of sweetness. As for the taste, it is full and lingering, with a slightly crumbly texture that melts in your mouth. The cheese has a real depth of flavor, thanks to the traditional methods used in its production.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Montgomery's Cheddar at room temperature. This allows the flavors to fully develop and enhances the cheese's unique texture. It can be presented on a cheese board or grated over dishes for a burst of flavor. It pairs perfectly with a variety of foods, such as crackers, fruits, and cured meats. For a complete experience, we suggest pairing it with a full-bodied red wine.
