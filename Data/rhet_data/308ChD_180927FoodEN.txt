1) Hafod Cheddar - Handmade by the Holden family on Wales' longest certified organic dairy farm, Bwlchwernen Fawr.

2) This traditional hard cheese is made from the milk of 65 Ayrshire cows, known for their rich and creamy milk. It is a medium-sized cheese with a smooth, chamois-like texture and a natural lard coating.

3) Hafod is made using traditional cheesemaking techniques, inspired by a 1917 book. The milk is first cultured with a yoghurt starter and then milled slowly to create a silky smooth curd. The cheese is then aged for several months, allowing its flavors to develop.

4) The aroma of Hafod is deep and buttery, with a hint of sharpness. The taste is mellow and earthy, with a long finish. The cheese has a rich and nutty flavor, thanks to the combination of organic Ayrshire milk and traditional cheesemaking methods.

5) For the best tasting experience, we recommend serving Hafod at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board or grated over dishes for added flavor. This cheese pairs well with a variety of foods, from crackers to fruits and nuts. It also goes perfectly with a glass of red wine.

6) Hafod has been recognized for its exceptional quality, winning the gold medal at the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards. This handmade, artisan cheese may contain blue veins, which are natural and add to its character. We take great care in sourcing and handling our cheese, ensuring that every piece is freshly cut and wrapped by hand. As our motto says, we unashamedly source, care for, and sell the best cheese because that is what we believe in.
