1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Colston Bassett Baby Stilton, a British Isles cheese made by Billy Kevan and his team in Nottinghamshire. With a rich history dating back to 1913, this cheese is made using milk from four original local farms that set up the co-operative. It is now famous for its velvety and smooth texture, and is often considered the best Stilton cheese.

2) Description of Product:
This smooth, velvety blue cheese comes in a baby size, weighing approximately 2kg. It has a full, well-balanced flavor with a slightly sweet taste and a 'mineral-y' tang. Made with pasteurized whole cows' milk, salt, cheese culture, penicillium roqueforti, and rennet, this cheese is suitable for vegetarians.

3) Description of the Process:
Colston Bassett Baby Stilton is hand-ladled and made to the same exacting standards as its larger counterparts. Local milk is left to set and then cut into small cubes before being drained and hand-ladled into curd trays. After being milled and packed into stilton hoops, it is left to drain naturally and then rubbed before being placed in maturing rooms. The cheese is pierced twice during the aging process to allow air to develop the blue veins.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
This intensely rich and creamy cheese has a deep, lingering, and complex flavor. It has a dense texture with a creamy mouthfeel and a full, rich taste. The blue veins add a subtle tang and a slightly sweet note to the overall flavor.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Colston Bassett Baby Stilton at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board or crumbled over salads and pastas. It pairs well with fruit, nuts, and crackers, and is the perfect addition to a cheese platter. For the ultimate indulgence, pair it with a full-bodied red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Port.

6) Quality Assurance:
Colston Bassett Stilton has received numerous accolades and has a reputation for being one of the best Stilton cheeses. It is made using traditional methods and is aged for four to six weeks before being released. The dairy has gone from strength to strength and continues to use the same local milk from four original farms. As Billy Kevan, the head cheese-maker, says, "Little has changed since we started making cheese in 1913." Trust in the quality and tradition of Colston Bassett Baby Stilton.
