1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Keen's Cheddar, a traditional, cloth-wrapped, unpasteurised cheese made by the Keen family in Somerset, British Isles. This cheese has a rich history, with the Keen family producing it since 1899. Today, brothers Stephen and George Keen, along with their sons, continue to run the family business and uphold the tradition of making this exceptional cheese.

2) Description of Product:
Keen's Cheddar is a hard cheese, made from 97% raw cow's milk, salt, starter medium SMP, animal rennet, starter, and pigs lard. It comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, and is coated with a cloth wrap. Each piece is freshly cut and wrapped to order, with a weight of approximately 100g. 

3) Description of Process:
The process of making Keen's Cheddar is a true labor of love. The unpasteurised milk is sourced from their own herd of 250 Friesians and is made according to a recipe that has been passed down through generations. The cheese is then aged for over 12 months in the farm store, where it is regularly turned, cleaned, and sampled to ensure its unique texture, tangy bite, and full-bodied flavour.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening the package, you will be greeted with the distinct aroma of Keen's Cheddar - moist, tangy, and powerful. The taste is even more impressive, with a perfect balance of creaminess and sharpness. The cheese has a unique tangy bite and a full-bodied flavour that will leave your taste buds craving for more.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Keen's Cheddar at room temperature. To add to the presentation, serve it on a wooden cheese board with some crackers, fruits, and nuts. This cheese pairs perfectly with a glass of red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot. It also goes well with a variety of dishes, from sandwiches to cheese platters.
