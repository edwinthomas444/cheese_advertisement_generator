1) Description of Cheese:
Colston Bassett Stilton is a hand-made cheese produced by Billy Kevan and his team in Nottinghamshire, in the British Isles. It is one of the last remaining hand-ladled Stiltons, with a rich history dating back to the 18th century when it was first eaten at The Bell Inn, Stilton. Today, it is a protected cheese and can only be made in the counties of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire.

2) Description of Product:
This intensely rich and creamy Stilton cheese is available in three sizes - Half Moon (1.35kg), Half Whole (4kg), and Whole (8kg). Each piece is freshly cut and wrapped to order, ensuring its quality and freshness. The cheese has a blue coating and is made from pasteurised whole cows' milk, salt, cheese culture, Penicillium roqueforti, and rennet.

3) Description of Process:
The process of making Colston Bassett Stilton involves hand-ladling the curd into trays, milling it, and packing it into stilton hoops. It is then left to drain naturally before being rubbed and placed in the maturing rooms. After four to six weeks, and again one week later, the cheese is pierced to allow air to develop the blue veins.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The Colston Bassett Stilton has a deep, lingering, and complex flavour, thanks to the hand-ladling process. Its velvety and smooth texture is complemented by a full, well-balanced, sweet, and 'mineral-y' taste. The cheese has a distinct aroma that is both rich and creamy.
