1) Description of Cheese:
Bath Blue, an award-winning creamy, Stilton-style organic blue cheese, is proudly produced in the South West by the Padfield Family at Park Farm. This family-run farm has been home to the Padfield Family for four generations and has been making cheese since 1914.

2) Description of Product:
Bath Blue is a round cheese with a creamy texture and even blueing throughout. It is made with organic cows' milk, sea salt, animal rennet, mould culture, and starter culture. Each piece is hand-cut and wrapped in waxed paper, ensuring the highest quality and freshness. It weighs approximately 100g per piece.

3) Description of Process:
Bath Blue follows a traditional Stilton recipe, but unlike most Stiltons, it is made entirely by hand in small batches. The cheese is aged in individual buckets, allowing for greater control over the cheese-making process and ensuring the highest quality.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Bath Blue has a rich and creamy aroma with a hint of blue mould. The taste is bold and tangy, with a creamy and slightly crumbly texture. The blue mould adds a unique and delicious flavor to the cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best taste experience, we recommend serving Bath Blue at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruit, or used in cooking to add a rich and tangy flavor. It pairs well with a variety of wines, such as port, sherry, or a full-bodied red.

6) Quality Assurance:
Bath Blue has received numerous awards, including being voted Supreme Champion at the 2014 World Cheese Awards and winning gold at the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards. Our cheese is made with organic milk from our own Friesian herd, ensuring the highest quality and taste. We are committed to sourcing, caring for, and selling the best cheese, as it is our passion and belief.
