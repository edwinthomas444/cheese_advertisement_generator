1) Description of Cheese: Graceburn is a luscious, creamy soft cheese that is produced by the Blackwoods Cheese Company in Kent, in the British Isles. This cheese is based on a traditional Persian Feta recipe and is made by David Holton and Tim Jarvis at Common Work Organic Farm.

2) Description of Product: Graceburn is a small, hand-crafted cheese that is marinated in herb-infused oil. It is made from raw cows' milk, which is sourced from a herd of Friesian Holsteins, cross-bred with Swedish Red and Montbeliarde cattle. The cheese has a soft texture and is coated in a blend of extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil, infused with thyme, garlic, bay, and pepper.

3) Description of the Process: To create Graceburn, David and Tim first soak the fresh cheese in brine. Unlike traditional Feta, which is preserved in larger blocks, Graceburn is broken by hand into smaller pieces and then steeped in the herb-infused oil. The cheese is then left to age, allowing the flavors to develop and intensify.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Graceburn has a rich and creamy aroma, with hints of garlic and thyme. The taste is buttery and smooth, with a slight tanginess from the brine. The aging process gives the cheese a depth of flavor that is both savory and slightly sweet.

5) Serving Suggestions: To fully enjoy the flavors of Graceburn, it is best served at room temperature. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board, accompanied by crackers, bread, and fresh fruits. It pairs well with a variety of foods, such as salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches. For a perfect pairing, try it with a crisp white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc.

6) Quality Assurance: Graceburn has received numerous accolades, including quotations from satisfied customers and awards for its exceptional taste and quality. The cheese has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure that it meets the highest standards. As David and Tim say, "The rich and creamy cows' milk makes Graceburn softer and more melt-in-the-mouth than traditional Feta." Try it for yourself and taste the difference.
