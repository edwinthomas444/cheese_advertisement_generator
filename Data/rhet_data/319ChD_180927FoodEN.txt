1) Description of Cheese: Baron Bigod is a luxurious brie-style cheese crafted by Jonny Crickmore in Suffolk, England. With a rich history of three generations of farming, Jonny has brought a traditional French cheese-making technique to the British Isles.

2) Description of Product: This cheese is a soft, round wheel with a wrinkled golden rind and a buttery paste. It is made from 97% cows' milk, carefully selected from Jonny's own herd of Montbeliarde cows. Other ingredients include salt, starter culture, and yeast and mould cultures.

3) Description of Process: The milk is handled with utmost care to preserve its delicate structure and then poured into the cheese vat. The curds are cut and transferred by hand, and the cheese is aged until it reaches the perfect level of ripeness. Each step of the process is done by hand, ensuring the highest quality and attention to detail.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Baron Bigod boasts a full, earthy flavor with a lingering finish. Its aroma is rich and inviting, while the taste is creamy and indulgent. As the cheese ages, the rind breaks down, revealing a soft, lactic center.
