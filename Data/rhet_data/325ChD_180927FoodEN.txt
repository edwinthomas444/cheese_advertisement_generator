1) Description of Cheese: Waterloo, made by the Wigmores in Berkshire, is a delicately flavoured, Guernsey-milk cheese with a rich history. Originally made with milk from the Duke of Wellington's estate, it now comes from a single herd of Guernsey cows near Henley.

2) Description of Product: This soft cheese is creamy and has a yielding texture. It is available in 200g, 400g, and 800g weights, with the 200g option freshly cut and wrapped to order. The ingredients include Guernsey cows' milk, starter culture, rennet, and salt.

3) Description of the Process: Anne and Andy Wigmore wash the curds for this cheese to lower the acidity, resulting in a gentle, sweet flavour. The cheese is then aged to perfection, allowing the flavours to develop and mature.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Waterloo cheese has a rich, buttery aroma with a lactic finish. Its taste is similar to hollandaise sauce, but with a unique sweetness from the Guernsey milk.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Waterloo cheese at a cool temperature, around 8Â°. It can be presented as a whole cheese or cut into smaller portions.
