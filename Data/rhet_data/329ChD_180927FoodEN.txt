1) Golden Cross - A Delicious British Cheese by Kevin and Alison Blunt
Golden Cross cheese is a delightful creation by Kevin and Alison Blunt, a couple who gave up their careers in Biochemistry and Human Biology to pursue their passion for cheese-making. This award-winning cheese is made from the milk of their own goats, which are raised on their farm in the British Isles.

2) A Unique Soft Cheese with a Subtle Flavour
This ripened goats' milk cheese is first rolled in ash, giving it a distinct appearance, and then matured to develop a complex, yet subtle flavour. The texture is smooth and creamy, reminiscent of ice-cream. Each cheese weighs approximately 100g and is coated with a bloomy penicillium candidum rind. The ingredients used are simple and natural - raw goats' milk, salt, microbial rennet, and a touch of charcoal.

3) Handcrafted with Care and Expertise
The process of making Golden Cross cheese involves a delicate balance of preparation and aging. Kevin and Alison carefully handcraft each cheese, following a recipe loosely based on the famous Sainte Maure goats' milk log from France. The young cheese is rolled in ash and then aged for a couple of weeks to develop its unique flavour and natural rind.

4) A Sweet, Delicate and 'Goaty' Cheese
Golden Cross cheese is known for its sweet and delicate taste, with a subtle hint of grassiness and a distinct 'goaty' flavour. The texture is soft and luxurious, with a creamy mouthfeel that is reminiscent of ice-cream. The ash coating adds a touch of earthiness to the overall flavour profile, making it a truly unique cheese.

5) Perfect for Any Occasion
This versatile cheese can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. For best results, serve it at room temperature to allow the flavours to fully develop. Golden Cross cheese can be presented on a cheese board, accompanied by crackers, fruits, and nuts. It pairs beautifully with a crisp white wine or a fruity red. For a more indulgent experience, try grilling it for a delicious and luxurious treat.

6) Quality Guaranteed with Numerous Awards
Golden Cross cheese has been recognized for its exceptional quality, winning the gold medal at the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards. It has also received rave reviews from cheese experts and food critics alike. Kevin and Alison take great pride in their cheese-making, ensuring that each batch of Golden Cross cheese meets the highest standards of quality and taste. As they say, "Our goats are our priority, and the cheese is just a bonus."
