1) Description of Cheese - Dorstone is a uniquely delicious cheese made by Charlie Westhead in the British Isles. This award-winning cheese has a rich history and is known for its exceptional quality.

2) Description of Product - Dorstone is a soft cheese coated in ash, with a delicate ice-cream texture. It is made from goats' milk, sea salt, charcoal, starter culture, and animal rennet. Each 100g serving contains 1175KJ of energy, 22.7g of fat, and 15.6g of protein.

3) Description of the Process - Dorstone is made using a slow lactic set recipe and the curds are pre-drained before being gently placed into moulds. This creates its light and mousse-like texture. After being removed from the moulds, it is coated in ash and aged to develop a faint veining similar to Carrera marble.

4) Description of Smell and Taste - Dorstone has a creamy and mellow flavor with a hint of lemon freshness. Its snowy-white curd and ash coating give it a unique and visually appealing appearance. The cheese has a pleasant aroma and a smooth, velvety texture.

5) Serving Suggestions - For the best taste experience, it is recommended to serve Dorstone at a temperature below 8Ëš. It can be presented on a cheese board as a centerpiece or paired with crackers and fruits for a light snack. It pairs well with a variety of wines, including Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.

6) Quality Assurance - In 2013, Dorstone was awarded a Gold Medal at the Mondial du Fromage competition in Tours, France, proving its excellence in taste and quality. It also uses only kids' rennet, allowing the cheese to stay true to its natural flavors. As quoted by Charlie Westhead, "Dorstone is as fine an example of an outstanding goats' milk cheese as any made by a Frenchman." This cheese has also passed rigorous quality tests, ensuring that each bite is of the highest quality.
