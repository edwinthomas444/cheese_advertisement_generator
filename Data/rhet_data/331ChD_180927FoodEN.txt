1) Description of Cheese:
Tymsboro' Ripened Pyramid is a unique and award-winning cheese made by Mary Holbrook at Sleight Farm in Timsbury, a small village just south of Bath in the British Isles. Mary, a pioneer in the artisan cheese industry, has been making cheese since the 1970s and continues to inspire and guide younger cheese-makers.

2) Description of Product:
This unpasteurised English goats cheese is shaped into a pyramid, coated with vegetable ash and has a weight of approximately 200g. It has a soft texture and a complex flavor that sets it apart from other cheeses. The ingredients used include goats' milk, animal rennet, lactic starter cultures, Penicillium cultures, sea salt, and vegetable ash.

3) Description of Process:
Tymsboro' is made using a traditional method where the curd is set using leftover whey from the goats' milk. This process, rarely seen even in France, allows for the unique and natural bacteria from the farm to develop and contribute to the cheese's flavor. After 24 hours, the curd is hand-ladled into molds and left to drain. The pyramids are then hand-salted, ashed, and aged for two to three weeks, resulting in a change in texture and a fuller, smoother flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The aroma of Tymsboro' is earthy and slightly tangy, with hints of goat's milk and a subtle smokiness from the vegetable ash. The taste is complex, with a creamy and mousse-like texture that melts in your mouth. As it ages, the flavor becomes smoother, rounder, and more robust, making it a delight for cheese lovers.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully enjoy the flavors and textures of Tymsboro', it is best served at room temperature. When presenting, place the pyramid on a wooden board and surround it with grapes, figs, and crackers. This cheese pairs well with a crisp white wine or a fruity red, such as a Pinot Noir. It also works well in salads, on a cheese platter, or as a topping for pizza.

6) Quality Assurance:
Tymsboro' has won numerous awards, including the prestigious World Cheese Awards. It has also been praised by renowned cheese experts and chefs, such as Mary Holbrook herself, who calls it "one of her best creations." The cheese also undergoes rigorous quality tests to ensure that every bite is of the highest quality, making it a must-try for cheese connoisseurs.
