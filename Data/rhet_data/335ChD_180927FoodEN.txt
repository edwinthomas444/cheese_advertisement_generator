1) Description of Cheese: Cornish Yarg, made by Catherine Mead and the Horrell family, is a traditional British cheese with a rich history. Its name is a nod to the original cheese maker, Alan Gray, who discovered the recipe in his attic. This cheese is a true representation of the British Isles.

2) Description of Product: Cornish Yarg is a hard cheese made from cows' milk and coated in stinging nettles. It has a fresh, clean taste and a beautiful, almost lace-like appearance. Each piece is hand-wrapped in waxed paper and weighs approximately 100g. The cheese is vegetarian-friendly, made with vegetarian rennet, and is suitable for pregnant women.

3) Description of the Process: This cheese is made using a traditional Caerphilly recipe and is carefully wrapped in stinging nettles, which are hand-picked from the local Cornish countryside. The nettles protect the cheese while it ages, allowing it to develop its unique flavor and texture. The cheese is then aged for several months in a purpose-built dairy.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Cornish Yarg has a delicate aroma and a fresh, clean taste. The nettles give the cheese a slightly herbaceous and earthy flavor, while the interior remains gently crumbly in nature. This cheese is perfect for those who enjoy a mild and creamy cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best taste experience, we recommend serving Cornish Yarg at room temperature. To fully appreciate the beautiful, nettle-wrapped appearance, present the cheese on a cheese board with some crackers and fresh fruit. This cheese pairs well with a crisp white wine or a light, fruity red. It also makes a delicious addition to salads and sandwiches.
