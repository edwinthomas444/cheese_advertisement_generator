1) Wyfe of Bath - A Delicious Organic Cheese from the British Isles
Inspired by the traditional Gouda-style cheese, Wyfe of Bath is a hand-made, single-herd cheese produced by Graham Padfield at Park Farm in the village of Kelston, near the historic city of Bath. With a rich history and a unique geographical provenance, this cheese is a true taste of the British Isles.

2) A Perfectly Crafted Cheese with Organic Ingredients
Crafted with love and care, Wyfe of Bath is a hard cheese with a sweet and rich flavor. Made from 98.37% organic cows' milk, sea salt, microbial rennet, water, and a non-GMO starter culture, this cheese is a true testament to the quality of its ingredients. Its shape and size are similar to a young Gouda, with a springy texture and a weight of approximately 100g.

3) Hand-Made and Aged for Four Months for Optimal Flavor
At Park Farm, everything is still made by hand, with the quality of the milk being of utmost importance. The organic milk from their own herd of Holstein Friesian cows is used to make the cheese, which is formed in a basket mould and aged for four months. This process results in a deep, rich flavor that changes slightly with the seasons.

4) A Sweet and Rich Taste with Hints of Buttercup Meadows
Wyfe of Bath is known for its sweet and rich taste, with hints of buttercup meadows in every bite. Its unique preparation and aging process give it a distinct flavor that is both irresistible and unforgettable. The cheese is also similar in style to a young Gouda, but with a more springy texture that adds to its overall appeal.
