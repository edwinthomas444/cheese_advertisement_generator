2) Description of Product:
Sharpham Rustic is a hard cheese made from the milk of Jersey cows, known for their rich and creamy milk. The cheese is shaped into a traditional wheel and coated with a layer of wild garlic and chives for a unique and flavorful twist. Each wheel weighs approximately 1kg and is made with vegetarian rennet.

3) Description of the Process:
The cheese-making process for Sharpham Rustic is truly special. The cows themselves play a role in the creation of this cheese, as they have a taste for the wild garlic that grows in their grazing fields. The cheese-makers then add more wild garlic and chives to the milk, allowing nature to work its magic. The cheese is then aged to perfection, resulting in a deliciously tangy and oniony flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The aroma of Sharpham Rustic is a delightful mix of rich, creamy milk and pungent wild garlic. The taste is equally as impressive, with a perfect balance of tangy and savory flavors. The addition of chives adds a subtle hint of onion, making this cheese truly unique and irresistible.
