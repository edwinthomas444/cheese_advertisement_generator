5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, we recommend serving Duckett's Caerphilly at room temperature. This allows the flavors to fully develop and the texture to soften. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruits, or used in cooking for a delicious twist on traditional dishes. This cheese pairs well with a crisp white wine or a fruity red.
