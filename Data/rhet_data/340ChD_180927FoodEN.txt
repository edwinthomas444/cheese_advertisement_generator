1) Description of Cheese: Beauvale, made by the Cropwell Bishop Dairy in the British Isles, takes its name from the Vale of Belvoir. This family company, known for their traditional Stilton cheese, has ventured into a new style with Beauvale.

2) Description of Product: Beauvale is a delicate, rich, and buttery blue cheese, inspired by soft, mild, European varieties like Gorgonzola Dolce. It is hand-ladled into wider, shallow molds and aged to develop a thin crust. Made from cows' milk, it is coated with a blend of dairy cultures, mold culture, and yeast culture, along with salt and animal rennet.

3) Description of the Process: Beauvale is made with care and precision, as the recipe was perfected over two years by cheesemaker Robin Skailes. The cheese is aged to develop a softer and milder flavor than traditional Stilton. Instead of rubbing the outside to create a rind, the cheese is left to develop a natural crust.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The resulting cheese is sweet and creamy, with a buttery texture and a slight, salty tang to finish. It has a pleasant aroma and a rich, indulgent taste that is sure to please any cheese lover.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Beauvale at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board or crumbled over salads and pastas. Pair it with fruits, nuts, and crackers for a delicious snack, or enjoy it with a glass of red wine for a perfect combination of flavors.
