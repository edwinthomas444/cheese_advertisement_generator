1) Description of Cheese: Golden Cenarth is a unique and award-winning cheese made by Carwyn Adams on his family farm in Carmarthenshire, British Isles. The Adams family has been farming for over 42 years, and cheese-making has been a tradition for six generations. This cheese has a rich history and geographical provenance, making it a truly special and authentic product.

2) Description of Product: Golden Cenarth is a smooth and supple cheese with a characteristic rind and savory, full flavor. It is a washed rind cheese, meaning it is washed in cider during the aging process. This gives it a unique and aromatic taste. The cheese is made from 98% cows' milk, along with salt, microbial rennet, starter culture, and Brevibacterium Linens. It is a semi-soft cheese with a weight of 100g.

3) Description of Process: Golden Cenarth is prepared using traditional methods, with a touch of innovation from Carwyn Adams. The cheese is aged to perfection, allowing the orange culture to soften the rind and give it a seductive pungency. The original strain of Brevibacterium is used in every batch, ensuring the unique and consistent taste of Golden Cenarth.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Golden Cenarth has a pungent and seductive aroma, thanks to the orange culture used in the aging process. The taste is full and savory, with a hint of sweetness from the cider wash. The cheese has a smooth and supple texture, making it a delight to eat.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, we recommend serving Golden Cenarth at room temperature, allowing the flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board, paired with crackers, fruits, and nuts. This cheese also pairs well with a variety of wines, such as a crisp white or a full-bodied red.

6) Quality Assurance: Golden Cenarth has won numerous awards, including Supreme Champion at the British Cheese Awards 2010 and Best British Semi-Soft Cheese in 2016.
