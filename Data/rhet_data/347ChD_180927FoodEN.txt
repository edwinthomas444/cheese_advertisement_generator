2) Description of Product:
This indulgent cheese is made from raw cows' milk, double cream, sea salt, starter cultures, and animal rennet. It has a soft, ice cream-like texture and is shaped into a round wheel. Each wheel weighs approximately 100g.

Finn is made using the cream of the milk enriched with double cream, following the traditional method of double-cream cheeses from France.

After a long setting time, Finn is wrapped and allowed to develop its creamy texture.
