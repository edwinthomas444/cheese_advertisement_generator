1) St Jude - A Taste of British Excellence
St Jude, a delicate and rich cheese, is hand-made by Julie Cheyney in Suffolk, UK. Julie uses milk from Montbeliarde cows to create this exquisite cheese. With a history of award-winning cheese-making, Julie's expertise and passion shine through in every bite of St Jude.

2) A Perfect Blend of Flavors and Textures
This tiny cheese, weighing at 90g, is full of flavor and complexity. The thin, wrinkled coat encases a dense, lactic core, creating a unique texture that melts in your mouth. Made with 98.20% cows' milk, along with salt, rennet, and starter cultures, St Jude is a true masterpiece of cheese-making.

3) Slowly Crafted for Perfection
Julie believes in the art of cheese-making and takes her time to create each batch of St Jude. The milk, still warm from the first cows into the dairy parlour, is transformed into this delicate, rich, and creamy cheese. Every step of the process is performed by hand, ensuring the highest quality and attention to detail.

4) A Delicate and Complex Flavor
St Jude's flavor is refined, yet deep and lingering. The combination of the Montbeliarde milk and Julie's expert techniques creates a cheese that is both delicate and complex. The taste is a perfect balance of creaminess and tanginess, making it a true delight for cheese lovers.

5) Perfectly Paired for Any Occasion
For the best experience, serve St Jude at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. This cheese can be presented on a cheese board, accompanied by crackers, fruits, and nuts. It pairs perfectly with a crisp white wine or a light red, enhancing its delicate flavors.

6) Quality You Can Trust
St Jude has been recognized for its excellence in cheese-making, winning the Supreme Champion at the British Cheese Awards. Julie's commitment to using the best milk and her dedication to the craft have resulted in a cheese that is truly exceptional. As Julie says, "cheese should be made slowly and gently," and St Jude is a testament to that philosophy.
