1) Yorkshire Pecorino Fresco - Made by Mario Olianas in Adel, near Leeds, West Yorkshire. Brought up in Sardinia, Mario comes from a strong family of Italian gastronomes.

2) This young Pecorino is smooth, yogurty, and sweet, with a thin undulating rind. It weighs approximately 1kg and is made from fresh sheep's milk collected daily from just outside Harrogate. Mario uses imported cultures and rennet from Italy.

3) Mario's passion for food led him to start making cheese in a specially converted room within his house, following an adapted Pecorino recipe. The cheese is aged for 30 days, giving it a soft and yielding texture.

4) The Yorkshire Pecorino Fresco has a delicate and pleasant aroma, with a rich and creamy taste. The young age of the cheese allows for a mild and balanced flavor, making it perfect for those who prefer a less intense cheese.

5) For the best experience, serve the cheese at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruit, or used in a variety of dishes such as salads, pasta, or grilled cheese sandwiches. Pair it with a light and fruity white wine for a perfect combination.

6) "A better Italian cheese than his brothers'." - Mario's dedication to creating high-quality cheese has been recognized by many. The Yorkshire Pecorino Fresco has won multiple awards and has undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure its excellence. Try it for yourself and taste the difference!
