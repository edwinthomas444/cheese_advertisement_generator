1) Description of Cheese: Hafod Cheddar, made by The Holden Family in Llangybi, Lampeter, Wales. This cheese has a rich historical and geographical provenance, as the Holdens have been running their organic farm for generations, and their cheese-making process is rooted in traditional methods.

2) Description of Product: Hafod Cheddar is a clothbound cheese, made from the milk of 65 Ayrshire cows on the Holden family farm. It has a round truckle shape and weighs around 14-months. The cheese has a smooth and buttery texture, with a tangy flavor that sets it apart from other Cheddars. The only ingredients used in this cheese are organic milk and rennet.

3) Description of Process: The Holden family follows a very traditional recipe for making Hafod Cheddar, resulting in a cheese that is truly unique. The cheese is carefully selected and matured on-site at The Courtyard Dairy for 14 months, allowing it to develop its distinct buttery flavors and special tang. The cheese is made by head cheesemaker Rob Howard, who has taken over the day-to-day cheesemaking from Sam Holden.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Hafod Cheddar has a distinctive aroma, with hints of yeast and toast. The flavor is rich and buttery, with a sharp tang that is characteristic of Cheddar cheese. Some pieces may also have blue veins, which is a natural occurrence and adds to the complexity of the flavor.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, Hafod Cheddar should be served at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers, fruits, and nuts, or used in cooking to add a rich and tangy flavor to dishes. This cheese pairs well with a variety of wines, such as Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon, and is a perfect complement to a variety of foods, including apples, pears, and cured meats.

6) Quality Assurance: Hafod Cheddar has received high praise from cheese experts and has won numerous awards, including recognition from the Soil Association and the Organic movement. The cheese is also regularly tested for quality to ensure that every piece meets the high standards set by the Holden family.
