1) Description of Cheese: Stichelton, made by Joe Schneider in Cuckney, Nottinghamshire, England, is a traditional blue cheese with a rich history. It is a recreation of the unpasteurised Stilton, which was lost forever in 1988 due to a change in regulations. 

2) Description of Product: Stichelton is available in three sizes - 1.3kg half moon, 2.6kg wheel, and 4kg half Stichelton, or 8kg whole Stichelton. It is made with unpasteurised milk, following a traditional Stilton recipe, and is hand-ladled for a superior quality. 

3) Description of the Process: Stichelton is made slowly and gently, with a traditional hand-ladling process to drain the curd. It is then rubbed up and aged slowly, resulting in a complex and creamy cheese. 

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Stichelton has a toasty, nutty, and sweet aroma, with a rich yet gentle blue note. Its taste is creamy and nutty, with a subtle blue flavour that is not overpowering. 

5) Serving Suggestions: Stichelton is best served at room temperature, and can be presented as a whole wheel or cut into wedges. It pairs well with a variety of foods, such as fruit, crackers, and bread. For a perfect pairing, try it with a full-bodied red wine. 

6) Quality Assurance: Stichelton has received numerous awards and accolades, including being named one of the few unpasteurised blue cheeses made on a farm. It has also been praised for its slow and gentle production process, resulting in an outstanding British classic.
