1) Description of Cheese: Baron Bigod Brie by Jonathan and Dulcie Crickmore, made on their farm in Bungay, Suffolk, England. This cheese is the first unpasteurised Brie to be made on the farm in traditional large wheels, and is named after the 12th-century Earl of Norfolk who owned the land on which the farm now stands.

2) Description of Product: This rich and creamy cheese is aged to perfect ripeness in The Courtyard Dairy's maturing rooms. It comes in two sizes - 1.4 kg for a half wheel and 2.8 kg for a whole wheel. Made with unpasteurised milk from a herd of French Montbeliarde cows, this Brie is hand-ladled and coated in a bloomy rind. The cheese is made using traditional methods and rennet.

3) Description of Process: Makers Jonathan and Dulcie Crickmore have been dairy farmers all their lives, but started making cheese due to falling milk prices. They saw a gap in the market for a large unpasteurised Brie and developed Baron Bigod. The cheese is aged for a specific amount of time to reach perfect ripeness, ensuring a creamy and delicious taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The French are jealous of this Brie, and for good reason. Baron Bigod has a rich and creamy texture with a bloomy rind that gives it a distinct aroma. The taste is smooth and buttery, with hints of earthiness and a slight tanginess. It is a truly indulgent cheese that will leave you wanting more.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Baron Bigod at room temperature to allow the full flavour to develop. The cheese can be presented on a cheeseboard with crackers, fruits, and nuts for a delicious appetizer or dessert. It pairs well with a variety of wines, such as a crisp white or a full-bodied red. It also goes well with crusty bread and a glass of champagne for a luxurious treat.

6) Quality Assurance: The quality of Baron Bigod speaks for itself, but it has also received recognition and awards. The cheese has a two-week shelf life from the date of delivery, and you can choose a delivery date well in advance for special events. Jonathan and Dulcie Crickmore take great pride in their cheese-making skills and have received positive feedback from customers and experts alike. As Jonathan likes to say, "if Baron Bigod were alive today, he would be pleased to know there is a good French-style Brie available in his home town!"
