1) Description of Cheese:
Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese, made by third-generation Lancashire-maker Graham Kirkham, is a true testament to the traditional two-day curd method of cheese-making. Hailing from the village of Goosnargh near Longridge in Lancashire, England, this cheese has a rich history dating back to the 13th century.

2) Description of Product:
This cheese boasts a unique combination of characteristics, including a buttery, yoghurty flavor and a light and fluffy texture that melts in the mouth. It is made from unpasteurized milk from their 70-cow family farm. The cheese is traditionally clothbound and aged for 3-6 months, giving it a distinct coating and a weight of 1.1kg.

3) Description of the Process:
The Kirkham family has been making Lancashire cheese for generations, with Graham learning the craft from his mother and grandmother. The two-day curd method involves combining curd from both days, resulting in a lactic, yoghurty flavor. The cheese is then aged for 3-6 months, allowing for the development of the unique texture and taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
This cheese has a distinct aroma, with hints of butter and yoghurt. The taste is equally delightful, with a rich and creamy flavor that is balanced by a fresh acidity. The fluffy texture adds a unique element to the cheese, making it a true delight for the senses.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully enjoy the flavors and textures of Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese, it is best served at room temperature.

For the perfect pairing, enjoy with a glass of full-bodied red wine.
