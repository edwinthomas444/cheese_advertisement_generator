1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Sinodun Hill, the newest and most exciting goats' cheese from Britain. Made on a farm in Shillingford near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, this cheese is a true testament to the rich history and geographical beauty of the region. Produced by Fraser Norton and Rachel Yarrow, this cheese is a result of their passion for cheese-making and sustainable farming.

2) Description of Product:
Sinodun Hill is a lactic cheese made from the rich milk of Anglo Nubian goats. Its mousse-like texture and zippy fresh taste are complemented by a herbaceous goaty finish. This cheese is small and long-set, with a wrinkly yeast coat and mottled blue and white molds (all edible). It weighs 200g and is formed into a small pyramid shape.

3) Description of Process:
Fraser and Rachel's journey to cheese-making started with reading The Courtyard Dairy's blog and attending courses at the School of Artisan Food. They later acquired their first cheese-making kit from Moorlands and started renting space from Nettlebed Creamery. Their cheese is made using a recipe based on the lactic cheeses of France's Loire valley. It is matured for three weeks, resulting in a soft delicate texture, rich creamy flavor, and delicate herby-goaty bite.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Sinodun Hill cheese has a delicate and fresh aroma, with hints of herbs and goat's milk. Its taste is light and delicate, with herbaceous flavors that leave a pleasant zing on the palate. The cheese has a zippy and refreshing finish, making it a perfect choice for cheese lovers.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, serve Sinodun Hill cheese at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. Its unique pyramid shape makes it a beautiful addition to any cheese board. Pair it with crackers, fruits, and nuts for a delicious snack or use it in salads and sandwiches for a burst of flavor. For a complete experience, pair it with a crisp white wine or a light red.

6) Quality Assurance:
Fraser and Rachel's dedication to their craft has not gone unnoticed. They have received numerous awards and recognition for their cheese, including a grant to build their own dairy on their small-holding. The cheese has a two-week shelf life from the date of delivery, ensuring its freshness and quality. As Fraser and Rachel themselves said, "It was a very helpful starting point; a good thing you wrote it!"
