1) Introducing Hebden Goat Cheese: Made on the picturesque TenAcres Farm in Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, England, this creamy and smooth cheese is a true delight for goat cheese lovers. Created by Gillian Clough in 2015, this cheese is a testament to her love for goats and her passion for creating high-quality cheese.

2) A Unique Product: Hebden Goat Cheese is made from the milk of just eight Anglo Nubian goats, renowned for their rich and flavorful milk. The cheese is molded and aged for three weeks, resulting in a smooth paste with a wrinkly rind. Each cheese weighs 120g and is coated with a natural geotrichium yeast rind.

3) Crafted with Care: Gillian milks her goats every morning and adds a small amount of lactic starter bacteria and rennet to the milk. The milk sets slowly, allowing for a longer aging process. After 2-3 weeks, the cheese develops its distinctive geotrichium rind, giving it a rich and creamy texture.

4) A Sensory Experience: Hebden Goat Cheese has a rich goat flavor with grassy undertones. Its smooth and creamy texture melts in your mouth, leaving a lingering taste that will leave you craving for more. The geotrichium rind adds a unique earthy aroma to the cheese.

5) Perfect Pairings: For the best experience, serve Hebden Goat Cheese at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. Its unique wrinkly rind makes for an eye-catching presentation on a cheese platter. Pair it with a crisp white wine or a fruity red for a perfect balance of flavors.
