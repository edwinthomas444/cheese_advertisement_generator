1) Description of Cheese:
Finn, a classic French-style triple-cream cheese, is a smooth, delectable, and rich treat made by Charlie Westhead in Dorstone, Herefordshire, England. This cheese is based on the traditional cream-enriched cheeses of France, such as Vignotte, Delice, and Brillat-Savarin. The unpasteurised milk used for Finn is collected from the local farm of Andrew and Rachel Giles in Glasbury-on-Wye, ensuring a truly authentic and high-quality product.

2) Description of Product:
Finn is a 200g cheese with a fresh lemony flavor and a creamy, smooth texture. It is made with unpasteurised milk from New Zealand Friesian cows, known for their high-quality milk. The milk is combined with double cream and a long, gentle set to create a rich and indulgent cheese. Finn is coated with a thin rind and has a delicate, melt-in-your-mouth consistency.

3) Description of Process:
The process of making Finn is a true labor of love. The milk and cream are carefully combined and set for a long period of time, allowing the cream to settle and create a rich, creamy texture. The cheese is then aged for three weeks, resulting in a fresh and lactic flavor that slowly develops into a rich and intense creaminess. This slow aging process is what makes Finn truly unique and delicious.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Finn has a delicate and fresh aroma, with hints of lemon and cream. The taste is equally delightful, with a perfect balance of tanginess and richness. The initial lactic flavor gives way to a creamy and indulgent taste, showcasing the high-quality milk and cream used in its production. Finn is a true treat for the senses.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, Finn should be served at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruit, or simply enjoyed on its own. Finn pairs perfectly with a crisp white wine, such as a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. It also makes a great addition to any cheese platter or picnic.

6) Quality Assurance:
The Courtyard Dairy, known for its outstanding selection of cheeses, proudly sells Finn and stands behind its quality and taste. The cheese has a shelf life of two weeks from the date of delivery, ensuring that it is always fresh and delicious. Additionally, the eco-friendly production process, use of high-quality milk, and attention to detail have earned Finn several awards and accolades. As Charlie Westhead himself says, "Finn is a cheese that truly showcases the beauty and flavor of milk and cream."
