1) Description of Cheese: Fellstone, made by Tom and Clare Noblet at Whin Yeats Farm in Cumbria, England. This farmhouse Wensleydale is based on a traditional 'dales' recipe from the north of England and is aged for three months, resulting in a fresh lemony-lactic flavor with a supple, firmer texture.

2) Description of Product: Fellstone is a unique cheese with a rich history and geographical provenance. It is shaped into a large truckle and coated with wax to preserve its freshness. Made with unpasteurized milk from 80 Friesian cows and 200 sheep, it is a true farmstead cheese. The rennet used is traditional and the ingredients are all natural, making it a high-quality and authentic product.

3) Description of the Process: The process of creating Fellstone cheese is a labor of love. Tom and Clare Noblet started making cheese in 2015 on their dairy farm in the Lake District. They built a complete dairy by hand and used a traditional 'smallholder' recipe to create a mild Cheddar. Seeking to develop a unique cheese, they turned to Andy of The Courtyard Dairy who suggested a Wensleydale-style cheese. Using old recipes and their own innovations, Fellstone was born - a three-month-old traditional Dales-style cheese.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The aroma of Fellstone cheese is mellow and succulent, with a sharp freshness that is characteristic of a good Wensleydale. The taste is equally delightful, with hints of lemon and lactic flavors. The texture is supple and firmer, making it a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with other foods.

5) Serving Suggestions: To truly appreciate the flavors of Fellstone cheese, it is best served at room temperature. Before serving, remove it from the fridge and let it sit for at least one hour. This will allow the full complexity of flavors to develop. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board, accompanied by crackers, fruit, and nuts. It also pairs well with a variety of foods, such as chutney, honey, and cured meats. For a perfect pairing, try it with a crisp white wine or a fruity red.

6) Quality Assurance: Fellstone cheese has received high praise and recognition. It is quoted as "farmhouse Wensleydale how it used to be" and has won awards for its unique flavor and quality. The cheese is made with care and attention to detail, ensuring that every bite is a true representation of the traditional Dales-style cheeses of the north of England. With a shelf life of up to twelve days, Fellstone is a must-try for any cheese lover.
