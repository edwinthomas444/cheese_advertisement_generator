1) Description of Cheese: Young Buck Cheese by Mike's Fancy Cheese Co. from Northern Ireland. A raw-milk blue cheese inspired by a Stilton recipe.

2) Description of Product: Young Buck is available in various sizes - 1.3Kg half moon, 2.6Kg wheel, 4Kg half, and 8Kg whole. Made from unpasteurised milk and hand-ladled, it has a creamy and smooth texture with a blue coating.

3) Description of the Process: Young Buck is traditionally made and hand-ladled, following a Stilton recipe. The curd is slowly acidified, hand-ladled, and rubbed to encourage a ruby-red yeast rind. It is then aged for 12-15 weeks before being sold at its peak.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: When fully mature, Young Buck has a rich, lingering flavor with a touch of Northern Ireland. It has a creamy and rounded taste, similar to the best Stilton, with a long-lingering finish.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Young Buck at room temperature and present it on a cheese board with crackers and grapes. It pairs well with a variety of foods, such as cured meats and fruits. For a perfect combination, pair it with a full-bodied red wine.

6) Quality Assurance: Young Buck is made by Michael Thomson, a new generation cheese-maker who studied at the School of Artisan Food and went on placements at Stichelton and Montgomery's. It has received high praise and awards, such as being named an outstanding, new, raw-milk, blue cheese from Northern Ireland. It also has a shelf life of two weeks from the date of delivery, ensuring the highest quality and freshness.
