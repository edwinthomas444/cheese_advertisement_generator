1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing the ï»¿Mini Cheddar Truckle, a traditional unpasteurised Cheddar truckle made by Jane Stewart in Anstruther, Fife, Scotland. Jane and her partner Robert have been farming in Fife for over 50 years, and in 2007 they started making cheese with the high-quality unpasteurised milk from their own herd of Holstein-Friesian cows. The result is a deliciously rich and tangy cheese that truly captures the essence of Scottish cheddar.

2) Description of Product:
These mini-cloth truckles come in a perfect gift size, and are made using a traditional recipe. Each truckle is handcrafted and made with love and care by Jane herself. The cheese is made using unpasteurised milk from her husband's cattle, and is aged for 14 months to achieve its powerful and sharp flavor. Each truckle weighs between 900g to 1kg, and is coated in a traditional cloth binding.

3) Description of the Process:
Jane's cheese-making process is a labor of love. She has crafted a recipe that combines the techniques of the North and South of England to create a crumbly, lactic, and fresh cheese. After attending a cheese-making course at Reading University and a fact-finding trip with renowned expert Leon Downey, Jane returned to the farm and created the famous 'Anster' cheese. The individual cheese truckles are made using small scale equipment and traditional techniques, such as cheddaring and hand-making.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The Mini Cheddar Truckle has a powerful and tangy aroma that will awaken your senses. Its sharp and complex flavor is a result of the 14 months of aging, and it truly captures the Scottish cheddar style. The cheese has a crumbly texture that melts in your mouth, leaving a lingering tangy aftertaste.
