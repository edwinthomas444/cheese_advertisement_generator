1) Description of Cheese: Amalthea Goats Cheese is a luscious and rich cheese made in partnership with The Courtyard Dairy. It is named after the Greek goddess Amalthea and is made by Haydn Roberts in Upper Broadheath, Worcester, England.

2) Description of Product: This cheese is made using a typical French recipe, but with a unique twist - it has delicate goat and yeasty flavors to balance out its freshness. It comes in a 150g size and has a thin, undulating natural yeast rind that gives it a rich and creamy texture. Amalthea is made with unpasteurized goats milk and uses a French lactic-style process that takes 24 hours or more to set.

3) Description of Process: Amalthea is made by Haydn Roberts, one of Britain's most promising cheese makers. He spent years working at Neal's Yard Creamery, helping to create and make some of their outstanding cheeses. After leaving the creamery, he started experimenting with different recipes, bacteria, and maturation techniques to create a goats' cheese that could rival the best in the UK. It takes six months for the cheese to be ready to sit on the shelves at The Courtyard Dairy, where it is quickly shipped and matured for three to four weeks.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Amalthea Goats Cheese has a rich and creamy aroma, with hints of delicate goat and yeasty flavors. Its taste is equally delicious, with a perfect balance of tanginess and creaminess. The natural yeast rind adds a unique depth of flavor to the cheese, making it a must-try for cheese lovers.
