1) Description of Cheese:
Beenleigh Blue is a unique and delicious cheese crafted by Ben Harris in Totnes, Devon, England. Originally based on a Roquefort recipe, this cheese has a delicate sweetness and minerally, floral flavor that sets it apart from its inspiration. It is made with milk sourced from a nearby farm in Somerset, where small farmer Tom Garland keeps 250 Friesland sheep. The cheese is named after the town of Beenleigh, located in the county of Devon.

2) Description of Product:
This cheese is a true delight for the senses. It has a distinctive shape and size, with a weight of 250g, making it perfect for sharing with friends and family. The texture is creamy and smooth, with a delicate blue veining throughout. The cheese is coated in foil to prevent rind development. It is made with sheep's milk and rennet, giving it a rich and sweet flavor.

3) Description of Process:
The process of making Beenleigh Blue is a true labor of love. The founder, Robin Congdon, developed the original recipe based on Roquefort, but has since created a unique cheese that stands on its own. The milk is sourced from nearby farms and is only used from January to July, when the sheep are grazing outside. The cheese is aged for four months, resulting in a flinty, minerally and light flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The aroma of Beenleigh Blue is enticing and complex, with hints of minerality and floral notes. The taste is equally as impressive, with a delicate sweetness that balances the blue undertones. As the cheese ages throughout the year, it becomes stronger and more mature in flavor, making each bite a unique experience.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Beenleigh Blue at room temperature. This allows the flavors to truly shine. When presenting the cheese, we suggest pairing it with a variety of fruits, nuts, and crackers for a well-rounded cheese board. It also pairs well with a crisp white wine, such as a Sauvignon Blanc.

6) Quality Assurance:
Beenleigh Blue has received high praise and recognition from cheese lovers and experts alike. The cheese has been featured in various publications and has won numerous awards for its unique flavor and quality. It has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure that each bite is as delicious as the last. As Robin Congdon, the founder of Ticklemore Cheese, says, "Cheese making is like farming bacteria," and we are proud to offer this exceptional cheese to our customers.
