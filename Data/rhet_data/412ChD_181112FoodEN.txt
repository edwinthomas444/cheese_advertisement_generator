1) Description of Cheese: Old Winchester, made by Mike and Judie Smales in Landford, Wiltshire, England. This Gouda-style cheese has a rich history, developed by the Smales as a way to use their surplus milk.

2) Description of Product: Old Winchester is a powerfully strong cheese with a crystalline texture and a weight of 18 months. Its unique flavors come from a combination of caramelization, smokiness, and crunchy crystals. Made from the milk of 180 British Friesian cows, it is also vegetarian-friendly as it is made without animal rennet.

3) Description of Process: The Smales' cheese-making journey began with a one-day Cheddar-making course, but they decided to take a different route and create a Gouda-style cheese instead. The curd is washed during the aging process, resulting in a slightly sweeter taste. This cheese is aged for 18 months to achieve its distinct flavor and texture.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Old Winchester has a unique and enticing aroma that combines the sweetness of Gouda with the nuttiness of Parmesan and the sharpness of Cheddar. Its taste is equally complex, with a sweet and tangy depth, and a crystallized finish.

5) Serving Suggestions: To fully enjoy Old Winchester, we recommend serving it at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. Its beautiful crystalline texture makes it a stunning addition to any cheese board. It pairs well with a variety of foods, but it is particularly delicious with fruits, nuts, and crackers. For a complete experience, we suggest pairing it with a full-bodied red wine.
