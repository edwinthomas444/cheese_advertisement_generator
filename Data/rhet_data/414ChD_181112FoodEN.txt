1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing ﻿Rollright, a delicious cheese from King Stone Farm in the Cotswolds, England. Made by David Jowett, winner of the prestigious ‘Supreme Champion’ and ‘Best Soft Cheese’ awards in 2016, this cheese is a true representation of the rich and diverse clover pastures of the region.

2) Description of Product:
Rollright is a mellow, buttery-rich ‘washed-rind’ cheese, with a soft and creamy texture. It is based on the renowned French cheese ‘Reblochon’ and is made using a traditional recipe. The cheese is made from the milk of 30 cows of mixed traditional breeds, including Brown Swiss, Jersey, Guernsey, and more. It is coagulated with rennet, giving it a distinct flavor.

3) Description of Process:
The cheese-making process of Rollright is a labor of love. David Jowett studied cheese making with the best in the industry and perfected his craft. The cheese is aged for three months, during which it is regularly washed in brine. This results in a thin, orangey-red rind and a soft, buttery interior, reminiscent of the diverse clover pastures of King Stone Farm.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Rollright has a distinct aroma, with earthy and nutty notes. The taste is rich and complex, with a buttery and creamy flavor that lingers on the palate. The unique combination of the diverse clover pasture and traditional cheese-making techniques results in a one-of-a-kind taste experience.
