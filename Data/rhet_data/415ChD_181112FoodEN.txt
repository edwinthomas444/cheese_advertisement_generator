1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Devon Blue, a modern British blue cheese created by Robin Congdon in the 1970s. This unpressed, French-style cheese is made by Ben Harris at Ticklemore Cheese in Totnes, Devon, England.

2) Description of Product:
Devon Blue is sold at four months old, when it is flinty, minerally and light with a subtle blue taste. It is shaped into a round wheel and coated in foil to prevent rind development. Made with cows' milk collected locally in the South Hams, this cheese is aged for four months and weighs approximately 250g.

3) Description of the Process:
The original recipe for Devon Blue was developed by Robin Congdon and based on Roquefort. He sourced the blue mould from a visit to the Roquefort caves and built a maturing cellar to mimic the conditions. The cheese is then moulded, pierced, and wrapped in foil to allow the blue mould to form.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Devon Blue has a unique combination of flinty and sweet with a gentle blue taste. Its aroma is both earthy and minerally, reminiscent of the Roquefort caves where it was inspired. As it ages, the cheese becomes creamier and stronger in flavour.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully enjoy the flavours of Devon Blue, we recommend serving it at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruits, or used in cooking to add a creamy and tangy element to dishes. This cheese pairs well with a crisp white wine or a fruity red.

6) Quality Assurance:
Robin Congdon and Ben Harris have dedicated themselves to producing high-quality cheeses, resulting in classics such as Beenleigh Blue, Harbourne Blue, and Ticklemore Goat. Their commitment to excellence has been recognized with numerous awards and positive reviews, making Devon Blue a must-try for cheese lovers. As Robin Congdon says, "cheese making is like farming bacteria," and we can assure you that the bacteria in Devon Blue are of the highest quality.
