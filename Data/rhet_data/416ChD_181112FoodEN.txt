1) Description of Cheese: Introducing Winslade, a brand new creation by Stacey Hedges and Charlotte Spruce from Hampshire Cheeses in Herriard, Hampshire, England. Inspired by traditional French cheeses, this soft, gooey delight is a cross between Vacherin and Camembert, encircled in a spruce strip. As featured on James Martin, Winslade is a true testament to the art of cheese-making.

2) Description of Product: Winslade is a unique cheese with a weight of 230g. Its shape and size are similar to Tunworth, another popular cheese from Hampshire Cheeses. Made from cow's milk and using rennet, Winslade is a perfect blend of creamy and tangy flavors.

3) Description of the Process: Stacey and Charlotte have spent two years perfecting Winslade, using expertise from cheese guru Ivan Larcher. The cheese is matured for eight weeks in a high ammonia environment, creating its distinctive pinky hue and dappled rind. The spruce strip adds a piney note and a rind similar to washed rind cheeses.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: When fully ripe, Winslade has a rich, soft, and gooey texture. Its aroma is a delicate blend of floral and piney notes, making it a treat for the senses. The taste is not as strong as Tunworth, but still has a gentle and creamy flavor with a hint of tanginess.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Winslade at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. To impress your guests, present the cheese on a wooden board with some crackers and fresh fruits. Winslade pairs well with a variety of foods, such as crusty bread, cured meats, and figs. For a perfect wine pairing, try a light red or a crisp white.

6) Quality Assurance: Winslade has received high praise and recognition within the cheese industry, winning the Best New Cheese award at the 2013 British Cheese Awards. Its quality and taste have been tested and approved by cheese experts, making it a must-try for any cheese lover. As Stacey Hedges says, "Winslade is a true labor of love, and we are proud to share it with the world." So why wait? Order now and experience the deliciousness of Winslade for yourself.
