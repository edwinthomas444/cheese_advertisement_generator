1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Stilton Cheese - the King of the Blues! This name-protected cheese hails from the British countryside, specifically the counties of Leicestershire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. The best Stilton is produced by specialists in large cheesemaking facilities in its home territory, ensuring the highest quality and authenticity.

2) Description of Product:
Stilton Cheese is a cylindrical cheese made from full-cream cows' milk, with no applied pressure during the making or forming process. It forms its own crust or coat and is typically aged for 6 to 18 months. Each 15 lb. drum of Stilton requires 17 lbs. of milk, resulting in a creamy, moist, and complex flavor. Only the finest ingredients are used, including pasteurized milk and rennet.

3) Description of Process:
The "secret" recipe for Stilton cheese involves two curdling processes. The curds are made from the cream from the evening milking, mixed with the full fat milk of the next morning's milking. The cheese is then aged, allowing air to circulate and promote natural bacteria growth. The unique soil in the legal domain of Stilton also contributes to the blue veins in the cheese.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Prepare to have your taste buds amazed by Stilton Cheese. Its huge aroma when served at room temperature is just a glimpse of the rich and complex flavors that await. The blue-green veins throughout occur naturally as the cheese ages, resulting in a creamy, moist texture and a bold, tangy taste.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the ultimate Stilton experience, serve at room temperature to fully appreciate its creamy texture and bold flavor. Presentation is key, so be sure to cut the cheese into wedges and arrange on a platter. Stilton pairs perfectly with fruit and nuts, making it a great addition to any cheese board. For a complete indulgence, pair with a full-bodied red wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Don't just take our word for it - the British High Court defines Stilton as the only name-protected cheese in Britain. In addition, the makers of Stilton must follow strict regulations and guidelines set forth by the Stilton Cheesemakers' Association. Look for the name Colston-Bassett when selecting Stilton, as they are known for producing the finest Stilton cheese. And as one respected cheesemaker once said, "Stilton cheese, with the exception that it makes no noise, is more trouble than babies." Try it today and see for yourself why Stilton is truly the King of Cheese.
