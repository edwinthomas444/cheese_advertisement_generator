2) Description of Product:
Coolea is a semi-hard to hard cheese, traditionally made on the farm in three sizes: 2, 9, and 19 lb. wheels. It resembles a Dutch Farmhouse (Boeren Kaase) Gouda, with a synthetic plasticote rind that allows the cheese to breathe. The cheese is typically aged for 6 to 12 months, resulting in a satisfying deep yellow interior paste and a somewhat chewy texture. It is made using high-quality milk and rennet.

Coolea is a farmstead cheese, made with traditional methods and aged to perfection. The cheese is carefully prepared and aged for 6 to 12 months, sometimes longer, to achieve the desired flavor and texture.

The texture is slightly chewy, making it a satisfying cheese to eat.
