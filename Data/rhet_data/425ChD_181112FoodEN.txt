1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing our ï»¿Cheddar Smoked Ceodre, handmade by skilled cheesemakers on a traditional estate in West Dorset, England. This cheese is steeped in history, with a name derived from the Anglo-Saxon word for Cheddar Gorge.

2) Description of Product:
Our Cheddar Smoked Ceodre is a beautifully crafted cheese, coated in wax for protection and aged for over 12 months to reach its full potential. It boasts a unique smoky flavor and creamy texture, thanks to its natural smoking over oak chips. This 200g cheese is made from the milk of carefully selected local herds and is suitable for vegetarians.

3) Description of Process:
Our cheesemakers rise early every morning to begin the meticulous process of making our Smoked Ceodre. The curds are cut and salted by hand, and the cheese is then aged for over a year to develop its distinct flavor. Once matured, it is smoked using traditional methods and coated in wax for preservation.
