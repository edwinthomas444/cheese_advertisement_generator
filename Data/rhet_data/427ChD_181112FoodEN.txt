1) Description of Cheese: Paxton & Whitfield's Lancashire cheese is a farmhouse cheese made in the traditional two day curd method. It is produced in Lancashire, England by Graham Kirkham, a third generation cheese maker from the Kirkham family. The milk used to make this cheese comes from their own herd of 100 Freisian cows, and the unique location of the farm near the Irish sea adds to the flavor and quality of the cheese.

2) Description of Product: This Lancashire cheese has a mild and buttery flavor, with a hint of sharpness. It has an open textured and crumbly consistency, and is coated with cloth and buttered for better maturation. The cheese is made from unpasteurized cow's milk, rennet, and dairy cultures.

3) Description of the Process: The process of making Lancashire cheese is unique among English cheeses. The evening milk is added to the warm morning milk and rennet is added, and the curd is cut by hand and allowed to settle. The whey is drained off and the curd is stored overnight. The following morning, the previous day's curd is mixed with fresh curd and the cheese is salted, pressed, and dried.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The Lancashire cheese has a distinct aroma of fresh milk and a rich, creamy taste with a tangy finish. The aging process gives it a sharp edge and a striking whiteness.

5) Serving Suggestions: This cheese is best served at room temperature to bring out its full flavor. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers and fruits, or used in cooking, such as in a classic Welsh Rarebit recipe. It pairs well with a pint of real ale and can also be enjoyed with a glass of red wine.

6) Quality Assurance: Paxton & Whitfield takes pride in providing the highest quality cheese to its customers. The Lancashire cheese has received numerous awards and accolades, and has been quoted as a favorite by cheese connoisseurs. The cheese is made with care and expertise, and is stored and served with specific instructions to ensure its freshness and flavor.
