1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Sparkenhoe - the only traditional farmhouse Red Leicester made in Leicestershire. This cheese has a rich history, being made on Sparkenhoe Farm since 1745, and is now being revived by the Leicestershire Handmade Cheese Company. Located in the South West Leicestershire countryside, this cheese is a true representation of its geographical and historical provenance.

2) Description of Product:
Sparkenhoe is a unique cheese with a complex mellow flavour and nutty, fruity tones. It is made in a traditional shape and size, weighing approximately 10kg and being wide but not particularly deep. The cheese is bound and matured in cloth and lard, giving it a distinctive coating. It is made with cows' milk, rennet, and dairy cultures, making it a true artisanal cheese.

3) Description of the Process:
The process of making Sparkenhoe is a true art form. The milk from the previous day's milking is pumped across from the parlour at 4 am and traditional animal rennet is added. The curds and whey are then scalded gently and separated, before being cut into blocks and turned to release further whey. The cheese is then pressed, bound in cloth and lard, and aged for 6 months in a temperature-controlled store.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Sparkenhoe has a distinctive aroma, with hints of caramel and liquorice. The taste is complex and nutty, with fruity undertones that make it stand out from generic Red Leicester. This cheese is a true representation of the Leicestershire countryside, with each bite taking you on a journey of flavour.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To truly appreciate the flavours of Sparkenhoe, we recommend serving it at room temperature. This cheese is best presented on a cheese board, with its unique shape and coating making it a standout piece. It pairs perfectly with crusty bread, crackers, and fruits such as apples and grapes. For the ultimate experience, pair it with a full-bodied red wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Don't just take our word for it - Sparkenhoe has received numerous awards and recognition for its exceptional quality. Made with unpasteurised milk and no vegetarian rennet, this cheese is a true representation of traditional farmhouse cheese-making. It has been quoted as having "one of the best herds of longhorns known anywhere" and has been praised by cheese experts and customers alike. Rest assured, you are getting the best of the best with Sparkenhoe.
