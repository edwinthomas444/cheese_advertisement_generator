1) Description of Cheese: Lincolnshire Poacher is a delicious and award-winning cheddar-style cheese produced by Simon and Tim Jones on their family farm in Lincolnshire, England. The farm has been in the family since 1917 and the use of their own unpasteurized milk from their dairy herd gives the cheese its unique flavor.

2) Description of Product: This open-textured cheese has a tangy and fruity flavor that lingers on the palate. It comes in a variety of sizes and weights and is made from cow's milk using traditional methods. The cheese is coated with a natural rind and is not suitable for vegetarians as it contains non-vegetarian rennet.

3) Description of Process: The cheese is made using a recipe similar to traditional West Country Cheddar, with some key differences that give Lincolnshire Poacher its distinct flavor and texture. The milk is carefully sourced from the farm's own dairy herd and the cheese is aged for 18-22 months, resulting in a depth and complexity of flavor.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The cheese has a rich and meaty aroma, with hints of fruit and nuts. On the palate, it has a clean and sweet finish, with a balance of tanginess and sweetness that makes it a crowd-pleaser.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Lincolnshire Poacher at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board or grated over dishes for added flavor. This versatile cheese pairs well with a variety of foods, from crackers and fruits to meats and salads. For a truly indulgent experience, pair it with a glass of red wine.

6) Quality Assurance: Lincolnshire Poacher has won numerous awards, including Best Hard and Best Cow at the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards. It has also received gold and silver awards at the British Cheese Awards. The cheese is made with the highest quality ingredients and is carefully aged to ensure the best flavor possible. As Simon Jones says, "The care and attention taken during the making of each individual batch of hand-made cheese is what sets Lincolnshire Poacher apart."
