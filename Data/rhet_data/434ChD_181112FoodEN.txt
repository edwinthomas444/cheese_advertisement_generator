1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing the award-winning ï»¿Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked, produced by Simon and Tim Jones on their family farm in Lincolnshire, England. This naturally smoked handmade cheese has a rich history and is made in the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds.

2) Description of Product:
Our Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked is a round, medium-sized cheese with a firm and slightly crumbly texture. It is coated with a golden brown color and delicate smoked aroma, thanks to the cold smoking process. Made from unpasteurized cow's milk and using traditional methods, this cheese is a true testament to the quality and care put into each batch. 

3) Description of Process:
The milk used for our Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked comes from our own dairy herd, grazing on the lush pastures of our farm. The cheese is aged for 14-16 months and then sent to a local smokehouse where it is cold smoked over untreated dampened oak chips for 24 hours. This process gives the cheese its distinctive fruity and nutty flavor, while still maintaining the traditional characteristics of a Cheddar.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening, our Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked delights the senses with its delicate smoked aroma. The taste is a perfect balance of oaky and fruity notes, with a hint of sweetness. The texture is smooth and slightly crumbly, making it a pleasure to eat.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving our Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board alongside crackers, fruits, and nuts. This cheese pairs well with a variety of foods, from hearty meats to fresh salads. For a complete experience, we suggest pairing it with a full-bodied red wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Don't just take our word for it, our Lincolnshire Poacher Smoked has won numerous awards, including Best Flavour Added Cheese at the British Cheese Awards in 2016 and 2009, and a Gold Medal in 2015. Our commitment to quality is evident in every batch we produce, and our cows are treated like royalty to ensure the highest quality milk. As Simon Jones says, "The care and attention taken during the making of each individual batch of handmade cheese is what sets us apart."
