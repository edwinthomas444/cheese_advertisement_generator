1) Description of Cheese:
Gorwydd Caerphilly, hand-crafted by Todd Trethown and his team at Gorwydd Farm in the Somerset region of England, has a rich history dating back to its origins in Wales. This traditional cheese has been brought back to life by Todd, who learned the trade from veteran Caerphilly maker Chris Duckett. The cheese is now made by Todd's brother Maughan and his wife Kim, who continue to uphold the traditional recipe.

2) Description of Product:
Gorwydd Caerphilly is a unique, mature cheese made from raw cow's milk and GM-free animal rennet. Its distinctive shape and size, with a creamy outer layer near the rind and a crumbly, citrus-flavoured centre, make it a stand-out among other cheeses.

3) Description of Process:
The process of making Gorwydd Caerphilly is truly artisanal, with the curd being worked by hand and the natural mould rind being encouraged to develop. This keeps the cheese true to its traditional origins and results in a stripy interior with a rich, softer texture. The cheese is then aged slowly, allowing its flavours to fully develop.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
When young, Gorwydd Caerphilly has a fresh, lemony tang. As it ages, the flavours become more intense and complex, with a creamy richness that adds depth to the cheese. The rind can also be enjoyed for a richer experience.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Gorwydd Caerphilly at room temperature to fully appreciate its flavours and textures. It can be enjoyed on its own or paired with a variety of foods, such as crackers, fruit, or cured meats. For a perfect match, try it with a crisp white wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Gorwydd Caerphilly has received numerous awards, including a Gold at the International Cheese Awards Nantwich Show 2017 and Best Territorial Cheese at the 2017 Artisan Cheese Awards. It has also been recognized for its quality by winning Super Gold at the World Cheese Awards and Gold at the British Cheese Awards and Global Cheese Awards. With its rich history and impressive track record, you can trust that Gorwydd Caerphilly is a cheese of the highest quality.
