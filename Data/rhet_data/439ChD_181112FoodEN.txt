1) Description of Cheese: Berkswell is a hard ewes milk cheese made at Ram Hall Farm in Warwickshire, England. It has a rich history, initially produced in the 1980s by the Fletcher family and now handmade by a team of six local ladies led by Julie. The cheese is named after the village of Berkswell in the West Midlands region of England.

2) Description of Product: Berkswell has a distinctive rustic appearance, with a pyreneean-style orange-brown crust. It comes in a variety of sizes and weights, with a firm and crumbly texture. The cheese is made from unpasteurised sheep's milk and uses lambs' rennet, giving it a unique and authentic taste.

3) Description of the Process: Every morning and evening, the milk from the farm's closed flock of 900 homebred Frieslan ewes is collected and mixed together. The milk is then tested for acidity and heated before adding the starter culture and rennet. The curds are then hand-moulded, salted, and aged for approximately 4 months.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Berkswell has a lively and intense flavor that varies with the season of production. It has a rich and caramel taste, with a savoury yet fruity quality that fills the mouth. The interior is almost translucent and pale white in color, adding to its unique appearance.
