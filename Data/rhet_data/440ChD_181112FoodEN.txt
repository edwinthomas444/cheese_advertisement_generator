1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing the Cheddar Pounder, a masterpiece of cheese-making from Paxton & Whitfield, a renowned cheese manufacturer with a rich history dating back to the 18th century. This cheese hails from the West Country region of England, known for its lush pastures and high-quality dairy products.

2) Description of Product:
The Cheddar Pounder is a miniature version of the classic cave-aged cheddar, made with pasteurized cow's milk and vegetarian rennet. It is handcrafted and cloth-bound, with a weight of 550g, making it the perfect size for a small gathering or a special treat for yourself.

3) Description of the Process:
This cheese is made using a traditional recipe and is aged in the historic Wookey Hole Caves of Somerset, where it develops a unique complexity and depth of flavor. The caves, with their consistent temperature of 11 degrees Celsius, provide the perfect environment for the cheese to mature for up to three months.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The Cheddar Pounder boasts a distinctively fruity and nutty flavor with underlying earthy notes, thanks to its maturation in the caves. Its dense and satisfying consistency makes it a delight to eat, and the lard used to adhere the cloth to the rind gives it a rich and creamy texture.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving this cheese at room temperature, allowing its full flavors to come through. It can be presented on a cheese board with crackers, fruits, and nuts, or used in cooking to add a depth of flavor to your dishes. Pair it with a full-bodied red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon, for a perfect match.

6) Quality Assurance:
The Cheddar Pounder has earned the prestigious Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for its adherence to strict specifications regarding its origin, milk source, and recipe. It has also received high praise from cheese experts and has won several awards, making it a cheese of exceptional quality and taste. As our founder, Charles Paxton once said, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating," and we guarantee that you won't be disappointed with this cheese.
