1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing the award-winning Cheddar Truckle from Paxton & Whitfield, a renowned cheese manufacturer with a rich history dating back to the heart of Dorset, England. This cheese is made with a traditional recipe using pasteurised milk from local herds and is matured in the historic Wookey Hole Caves of Wells, Somerset, where it gains a distinctive complexity.

2) Description of Product:
The Cheddar Truckle is a mini cloth bound cheddar with a weight of 1.8kg, making it the perfect size for any occasion. It has a full and fruity flavour, thanks to the use of cow's milk and vegetarian rennet. Please note that while the rennet used is vegetarian, lard is used to adhere the cloth to the rind, making it not suitable for vegetarians.

3) Description of the Process:
The Cheddar Truckle is handmade and aged for up to three months in the unique environment of the Wookey Hole Caves. These caves have existed for millions of years and provide a consistent temperature of 11 degrees Celsius, creating the perfect conditions for maturation. This cheese also holds a coveted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), ensuring its quality and authenticity.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Upon opening, the Cheddar Truckle delights with its distinctively fruity aroma, followed by a nutty bite. As it is aged in the caves, it also has underlying earthy notes, giving it a complex and satisfying taste. Its dense consistency adds to the overall experience of this delicious cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving the Cheddar Truckle at room temperature. Before eating, remove the cloth coating with a knife. This cheese pairs perfectly with crusty bread, crackers, or fresh fruit. For a complete indulgence, pair it with a glass of red wine, such as a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon.
