1) Description of Cheese:
Cerney Ash is a delicious goats cheese produced by the renowned manufacturer in Cerney, Gloucestershire. With a long history of cheese-making in this region, Cerney Ash is a true representation of the traditional and high-quality cheeses produced in this area.

2) Description of Product:
This award-winning cheese is shaped in a truncated pyramid, similar to the famous Valencay cheese. Coated in a mix of oak ash and sea salt, Cerney Ash is not just visually appealing but also serves as a protective layer for its light and delicate texture. Weighing in at 250g, this cheese is made from unpasteurised goat milk and uses vegetarian rennet.

3) Description of Process:
Cerney Ash is prepared with great care and attention to detail. The cheese is aged to perfection, allowing its flavours to develop and mature. The result is a cheese that is light and mild when young, but as it ages, it becomes nuttier and more robust in taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
With its light, citrus tang and mousse-like texture, Cerney Ash is a truly unique cheese. The goat flavour is present but not overpowering, making it a perfect choice for those who may not typically enjoy goat cheese. As it matures, the cheese develops a nutty taste that adds depth to its already delicious flavour profile.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully appreciate the flavours of Cerney Ash, we recommend serving it at room temperature. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board with other delicate flavours and pairs well with pilsner or a light summery cider. It can also be used in cooking, adding a creamy richness to salads. One of our favourite recipes is to have it on fried aubergine slices and drizzled with honey.

6) Quality Assurance:
Cerney Ash is a multiple award-winning cheese, including being named 'Best Goat Cheese' at the 2015 World Cheese Awards. This cheese has been recognized for its exceptional quality and taste, making it a must-try for all cheese lovers. Our commitment to quality is evident in every bite, and we are confident that you will agree with us after your first taste.
