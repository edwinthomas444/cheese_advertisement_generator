1) Description of Cheese:
Shropshire Blue, made by Tuxford & Tebbutt creamery, is a full-bodied and high quality cheese with a rich history. Originally created in the 1970s at Castle Stuart dairy in Inverness, it was marketed as Shropshire Blue despite having no links to the region. Today, it is commonly produced in the East Midlands alongside its cousin, Stilton.

2) Description of Product:
This cheese is known for its strong nutty flavor and delightfully smooth and creamy texture. It is made using pasteurized milk and is salted and milled into hoops before being transferred to maturing stores. The cheese is also distinguished by its rich orange color, created by the addition of natural food coloring called Annatto. It comes in a variety of sizes and weights, making it a versatile option for any occasion.

3) Description of the Process:
Shropshire Blue is made in a similar process to Stilton, with expert cheesemakers carefully adding the exact quantities of ingredients to perfect its unique flavor and texture. The cheese is then aged to allow the flavors to fully develop, resulting in a rich and complex taste.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The cheese has a strong and distinct aroma, with hints of nuttiness and a slight tang. Its taste is robust and creamy, with a perfect balance of savory and tangy flavors. The delicate blue veins add a beautiful contrast to the rich orange color, making it a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.

5) Serving Suggestions:
