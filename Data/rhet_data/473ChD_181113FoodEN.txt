1) Cheddar Cheese - Crafted by Arla Creameries in England, Scotland, and Wales

2) Our Cheddar cheese is available in a variety of maturities, from mild to Extra Mature & Vintage. Made with fresh milk from our Arla farmers, it is gently pasteurised and poured into vats. Starter cultures and vegetarian rennet are added to produce curds, which are then milled and salted for preservation and flavour enhancement.

3) Our award-winning Cheddar cheese is crafted in timeless fashion at our traditional British creameries. The cheeses are carefully watched over by our expert cheese graders as they mature in cold stores for up to two years for our punchiest Extra Mature Cheddars.

4) With a satisfying balance of sweet and savoury notes, our Cheddar cheese boasts a rich and powerful flavour that is truly unique. The aroma of our Cheddars is sure to tantalize your taste buds and leave you wanting more.
