1) Description of Cheese:
Hafod Welsh Organic Cheddar is a traditional hard cheese handmade by Bwlchwernen Fawr, the longest certified organic dairy farm in Wales. The name "Hafod" (pronounced Havod) means "summer place" or "pasture" in Welsh, reflecting the farm's location next to the river Aeron where the cows graze.

2) Description of Product:
Hafod is made using only raw (unpasteurised) milk from 75 Ayrshire cows, known for their rich butterfat and protein content. This unique combination of organic Ayrshire milk and traditional cheesemaking techniques results in a buttery, rich and nutty flavor. The cheese is typically sold in blocks and weighs approximately 200g.

3) Description of Process:
The cheesemaking process at Bwlchwernen Fawr has been passed down for over 40 years and is overseen by Patrick Holden, CEO of the Sustainable Food Trust. The milk is heated and mixed with rennet, then left to curdle before being cut into small pieces. The curds are then pressed and aged for a minimum of 16 months, giving Hafod its distinct flavor and texture.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Hafod has a distinct, earthy aroma with hints of nuttiness. The taste is rich and buttery, with a slight tang and a lingering nutty finish. The texture is firm yet creamy, with a slight crumble.

5) Serving Suggestions:
To fully enjoy the flavors and textures of Hafod, it is best served at room temperature. Cut into thin slices and serve on a cheese board with crackers or crusty bread. Hafod pairs well with fruits such as apples and pears, as well as cured meats like prosciutto. For a perfect pairing, try it with a full-bodied red wine such as a Cabernet Sauvignon.

6) Quality Assurance:
Hafod has received numerous accolades, including being named "Best Traditional Cheddar" at the British Cheese Awards. It has also been praised by renowned chefs and food critics for its exceptional flavor and quality. Bwlchwernen Fawr takes great pride in their organic and sustainable farming practices, ensuring the highest quality of milk and cheese production.
