1) Description of Cheese:
Renegade Monk is a unique and daring cheese made by Marcus Fergusson at Felthams Farm. Inspired by Continental cheeses, this cheese breaks tradition and stands out as a renegade in the British cheese scene. The name also pays homage to the Knights Templar, adding a touch of mystery and intrigue. Felthams Farm is located near Templecombe, where a Templar Preceptory was established in 1185.

2) Description of Product:
Renegade Monk is made from organic, pasteurised cowsâ€™ milk and hand-washed in ale every few days as it matures. This results in a hybrid cheese, combining the attributes of soft white cheese, blue cheese, and rind-washed cheese. The cheese comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, with a firmer rind and a milder interior when aged, and a softer, almost liquid texture when encouraged. The cheese is coated in a pale rind with a scatter of blue, and has a pungent, goaty inner core. The weight of the cheese varies depending on the stage of maturity.

3) Description of Process:
Renegade Monk is carefully crafted by Marcus Fergusson using milk from Bruton Organic Dairy and ale from the Milk Street Brewery in Frome. The cheese is aged for no more than four weeks, during which time it is hand-washed in ale. This technique originated in the Franciscan monasteries of France and Belgium, adding a touch of history and tradition to this renegade cheese.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The unique combination of milk, ale, and aging process gives Renegade Monk a distinct smell and taste. The cheese has a pungent aroma, with hints of ale and a slight goaty tang. The taste is complex, with a creamy and mild interior and a stronger, more robust flavor near the rind. The cheese can be enjoyed at different stages of maturity, offering a range of flavors and textures.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, Renegade Monk should be served at room temperature. The cheese can be presented on a cheese board, with the rind intact for a visually appealing display. It pairs well with a variety of foods, such as crusty bread, crackers, and fruit. For a perfect combination, serve with a glass of red wine, such as a bold Cabernet Sauvignon or a fruity Pinot Noir.

6) Quality Assurance:
Renegade Monk has received high praise and recognition in the cheese world. It has been quoted as a "daring and delicious" cheese by cheese experts and has won multiple awards for its unique flavor and quality. The cheese also undergoes rigorous quality tests to ensure it meets the highest standards. With Renegade Monk, you can be assured of a cheese that is not only bold and flavorful, but also of the highest quality.
