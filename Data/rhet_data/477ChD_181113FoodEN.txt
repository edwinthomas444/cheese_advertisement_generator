1) Description of Cheese:
Introducing Chevington Cheese, a deliciously unique creation from the Northumberland Cheese Company. With a rich history dating back to 1895, this cheese was first produced by Mr John W Annett in the small village of Chevington in Northumberland. After a brief hiatus, it was revived in 2001 by Marc Robertson, who discovered the original recipe and brought it back to life. For a taste of wild Northumbrian history, look no further than Chevington Cheese.

2) Description of Product:
This smooth and creamy cheese is made using pasteurised Jersey Cows' Milk from local herds at Wheelbirk's Farm in Corbridge, Northumberland. It is coated with a mould-ripened layer, giving it a sharp, clean bite followed by a gentle richness. Weighing in at various sizes, Chevington is available to suit all cheese lovers. It is also suitable for vegetarians, as it is made with vegetarian rennet.

3) Description of Process:
At the Northumberland Cheese Company, we take great care in preparing and aging our Chevington Cheese. The original recipe from Mr Annett is followed closely, ensuring the same delicious taste that has been enjoyed for over a century. The cheese is then aged to perfection, allowing the flavours to develop and mature.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
The aroma of Chevington Cheese is irresistible, with a hint of earthiness and a touch of sweetness. Upon tasting, you will be greeted with a smooth and creamy texture, followed by a sharp, clean bite that leads to a gentle richness. The taste is reminiscent of a hard English brie, making it an easy cheese to love.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Chevington Cheese at room temperature. This allows the flavours to fully develop and enhances the creamy texture. As for presentation, this cheese is a beautiful addition to any cheese board. It pairs well with crusty bread, crackers, and fresh fruit. For a complete indulgence, try it with a glass of your favourite red wine.
