Introducing Keltic Gold, a masterpiece from the renowned cheese manufacturer, Miss Muffet. This cheese has a rich history, originating from the Celtic region and is a true representation of the flavors of the French Alps.

This process, along with hand scrubbing, encourages the growth of pungent edible golden rind, giving Keltic Gold its distinct flavor and appearance.
