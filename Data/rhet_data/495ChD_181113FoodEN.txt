1) Description of Cheese: Landaff Creamery's Landaff cheese, crafted by Deb and Doug Erb on their second-generation dairy farm in the White Mountains, is a traditional Welsh style cheddar.

2) Description of Product: This 9-pound wheel of Landaff has a natural rind and a semi-firm paste, with subtle aromas of cave and grass. It is made from raw cow milk and aged for 4-6 months.

3) Description of the Process: The Erbs' determined pursuit of cheesemaking as a way to revitalize their farm led to the development of Landaff. Doug studied with the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese and learned to make Caerphilly with the Duckett family of Somerset, England.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Landaff's balanced complexity harmonizes a bright buttermilk tang and savory brown butter notes, creating a unique and indulgent flavor profile.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Landaff at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. It pairs well with a wide array of accompaniments, such as raw honey, whole-grain mustard, smoked meats, or berry preserves. It also goes well with a sturdy white wine or crisp pilsner. Additionally, Landaff can be used in cooking as it melts exceptionally well while retaining its smooth body and indulgent character.

6) Quality Assurance: Landaff has received high praise and recognition, including quotations and awards, for its exceptional taste and quality. It has also undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure its consistency and excellence.
