1) JASPER HILL CREAMERY - A TASTE OF TRADITION
Founded in Vermont, Jasper Hill Creamery is renowned for their commitment to traditional cheesemaking methods. Their award-winning cheeses are a testament to their dedication to producing the highest quality products. Among their offerings is the delectable WINNIMERE.

2) A UNIQUE WINTER CHEESE EXPERIENCE
WINNIMERE is a take on classic Jura Mountain cheeses, such as Vacherin Mont d’Or and Försterkäse. This 13 ounce wheel is wrapped in strips of spruce cambium, giving it a unique appearance and flavor. Made from raw winter cow milk and aged for 60 days, this cheese boasts a creamy texture and a bark-wrapped washed coating.

3) TRADITIONAL PREPARATION AND AGING
In keeping with tradition, WINNIMERE is made only during the winter months when Jasper Hill’s Ayrshire cows produce rich, hay-fed raw milk. During aging, the cheese is washed in a cultured salt brine to ensure even rind development. This process results in a cheese that is spoonably soft and bursting with flavor.

4) A SENSORY DELIGHT
WINNIMERE is a sensory experience like no other. As the cheese ages, it develops a strong aroma of bacon, sweet cream, and spruce. The taste is equally complex, with notes of smoky bacon and a hint of sweetness. The combination of flavors and aromas make for a truly indulgent cheese.

5) PERFECT FOR ANY OCCASION
For the best experience, WINNIMERE should be enjoyed by peeling away a bit of the top rind and diving in with a spoon. This cheese is best served at room temperature and pairs perfectly with a smoky, meaty red wine or a porter-style beer. For a truly decadent experience, serve alongside some Vermont whey-fed bacon.

6) AWARD-WINNING QUALITY
WINNIMERE has been recognized as the 'Best in Show' at the American Cheese Society Awards in 2013. This prestigious award is a testament to the quality and excellence of this cheese. Jasper Hill Creamery takes great pride in their products and ensures each wheel of WINNIMERE meets their high standards before it reaches your plate.
