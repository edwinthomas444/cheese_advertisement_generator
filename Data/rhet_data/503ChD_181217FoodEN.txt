1) Baron Bigod - A Taste of Suffolk
This exquisite cheese is named after Baron Bigod, a historical figure who once ruled over the beautiful region of Suffolk, England. Hand-made by the Cricklemore family, this cheese is a true representation of the traditional and rich flavors of the area.

2) Creamy and Delicate - A Perfect Combination
Baron Bigod is a large 28cm diameter round cheese, made with bloomy unpasteurised cows milk. The unique and delicate milky flavors of the Montbeliarde cows milk, combined with rich, earthy mushroom notes, create a perfect balance of taste and texture. This cheese is coated with a velvety white rind, adding to its appeal.

3) Craftsmanship at its Finest
The production of Baron Bigod involves a meticulous process, ensuring the highest quality cheese. The milk is gravity-fed and no pumps are used during production, preserving the fragile fat globules. The curds are hand-ladled into large round moulds, using traditional pelle-a-brie ladles. The young cheeses are then aged for up to 8 weeks in a humid cave-like environment, allowing the flavors to develop.

4) A Symphony of Flavors
Baron Bigod has a great depth of flavor, with a lovely golden hue to its rich paste. The protein-rich milk used in its production makes it easily digestible for those with milk intolerances. The combination of creamy, milky, and earthy notes creates a symphony of flavors that will leave your taste buds wanting more.

5) Perfectly Paired
For the best experience, we recommend serving Baron Bigod at room temperature, allowing its complex flavors to fully develop. This cheese is best presented on a cheese board, alongside some crackers, fresh fruits, and nuts. It pairs perfectly with a glass of full-bodied red wine, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.

6) Quality Guaranteed
Don't just take our word for it, Baron Bigod has received numerous accolades and awards for its exceptional taste and quality. Made with the finest ingredients and crafted with care, this cheese is a true representation of the craftsmanship and dedication of the Cricklemore family. Try it for yourself and taste the difference.
