1) Description of Cheese: Introducing the award-winning Lincolnshire Poacher, a hard, mature cheese handcrafted by the Jones brothers from their own pedigree Holstein herd in the heart of the rolling Lincolnshire Wolds. This Supreme Champion cheese hails from Ulceby Cross, Lincolnshire, and is a perfect blend of cheddar and Swiss mountain cheese.

2) Description of Product: The Lincolnshire Poacher is a hardpressed, full-fat cheese with a slightly open texture. It comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, with each wheel weighing approximately 2.5 kg. Made from the milk of cows, this cheese is free from any artificial additives or preservatives, and is coagulated using traditional rennet.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, we recommend serving the Lincolnshire Poacher at room temperature to fully appreciate its rich and complex flavors. This cheese pairs perfectly with a slice of buttered Lincolnshire Plum Bread, making it an ideal addition to any cheese board. For a more indulgent treat, try melting it over a hearty steak or adding it to a grilled cheese sandwich. For wine pairing, we suggest a full-bodied red such as a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Malbec.
