1) Description of Cheese:
Ticklemore is a unique and delicious handmade goats cheese that originates from the village of Ticklemore in England. Originally created by Robin Congdon, the recipe has now been passed down to Debbie Mumford who produces this exceptional cheese on the Sharpham Estate Farm. 

2) Description of Product:
Ticklemore is a medium strength cheese with a crumbly texture, thanks to its unusual basket mould. It is aged for 2-3 months, allowing it to develop a natural rind and a mature, lingering flavour. This cheese is made from pasteurised goats milk and uses high-quality rennet to ensure its exceptional taste.

3) Description of the Process:
Ticklemore is carefully handmade and pressed in a unique basket mould, giving it its distinctive shape and texture. It is then allowed to age for 2-3 months, during which time the texture softens and becomes richer, resulting in a truly delicious cheese.

4) Description of Smell and Taste:
Ticklemore has a delightful aroma, with hints of earthy and grassy notes. Its taste is equally delightful, with a mature and lingering flavour that is both tangy and creamy. The aging process also adds depth and complexity to its taste, making it a truly unique and delicious cheese.

5) Serving Suggestions:
For the best experience, we recommend serving Ticklemore at room temperature to fully appreciate its flavours and textures. This cheese is perfect for a cheese board, and its crumbly texture makes it easy to spread on crackers or bread. It pairs beautifully with fruits, nuts, and honey, and is best enjoyed with a crisp white wine.

6) Quality Assurance:
Ticklemore has received numerous accolades, including being named after the village in which it was originally produced. It has also been aged for 6-8 weeks, ensuring its quality and consistency. With its unique taste and exceptional quality, Ticklemore is sure to impress even the most discerning cheese lovers.
