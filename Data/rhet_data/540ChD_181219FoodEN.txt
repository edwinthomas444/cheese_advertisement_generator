1) Description of Cheese: Wild Garlic Yarg is a unique cheese crafted by a small, family-owned dairy in Liskeard, Cornwall. This cheese has a rich history, inspired by the traditional Cornish Yarg recipe, and is made with the freshest milk from their own and neighboring herds of cows.

2) Description of Product: This young cheese has a semi-firm texture and a slightly crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Each wheel is hand-wrapped in strips of fresh wild garlic, harvested from the surrounding woodlands, giving it a subtle hint of garlic on the finish. With a weight of 8 weeks or more, it is a perfect size for sharing and is suitable for vegetarians.

3) Description of Process: Wild Garlic Yarg undergoes a longer maturation process compared to the original Yarg. This is due to the well-known medicinal and anti-bacterial properties of garlic, which also helps prevent the pace of natural mold development. The result is a rich and creamy cheese with a restrained hit of garlic on the finish.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The aroma of Wild Garlic Yarg is enticing, with a subtle hint of garlic and a creamy, buttery scent. On the palate, it has a delicate and slightly tangy flavor, similar to a young Caerphilly cheese, with a smooth and creamy texture.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Wild Garlic Yarg at room temperature to fully appreciate its flavors and textures. This cheese is perfect for a cheeseboard, paired with crackers, crusty bread, and fresh fruits. It also pairs well with a crisp white wine or a light-bodied red.

6) Quality Assurance: Wild Garlic Yarg has received numerous awards and accolades, including being named a Great Taste Award winner. It has also been praised by cheese connoisseurs for its unique flavor and high-quality ingredients. Rest assured, every bite of Wild Garlic Yarg is a testament to the dairy's commitment to producing exceptional cheese.
