5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, serve Baron Bigod at room temperature to allow its flavors to fully develop. It can be presented on a cheese board, where the gooey cheese will slowly spread, or used in a variety of dishes. We recommend pairing it with Millers Elements Fire crackers for a spicy kick, or Millers Damsels Buttermilk for a milder option. It also makes for a delicious addition to a toastie, paired with chorizo and a chilli jam. For the ultimate indulgence, try it with a glass of wine, such as a crisp white or a full-bodied red.
