5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, we recommend serving Strathearn at room temperature, allowing the flavours to fully develop. This cheese pairs perfectly with oatcakes and a glass of single malt whisky, creating a beautiful combination of Scottish flavours. For wine lovers, a full-bodied red wine complements the cheese's bold taste.
