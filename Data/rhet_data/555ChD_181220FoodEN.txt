Winterdale Shaw, created by Robin and Carla Betts at their farm in Fairseat, Kent, is a true representation of the rich history and geographical beauty of the region. Made with milk from their family farms' cows, this cheese has been in production since 2006 and has become a multiple award winner, even receiving praise from Prince Charles himself.

2) A Perfectly Crafted Cheese: 
Winterdale Shaw is a 10kg truckle cheese, handcrafted in small batches using unpasteurised milk and vegetarian rennet. Each truckle is then cloth wrapped and matured for a minimum of 9 months, resulting in a unique and complex flavor profile.

3) The Art of Cheese Making: 
The process of creating Winterdale Shaw is a labor of love. From the use of unpasteurised milk to the careful selection of vegetarian rennet, every step is taken to ensure the highest quality cheese. The cheese is then aged for a minimum of 9 months, allowing the flavors to develop and mature.

4) A Symphony of Smell and Taste: 
Winterdale Shaw is a clean and nutty cheese, with a refreshing lemony tang that lingers on the palate. The flavors are complex and well-balanced, providing a delightful experience for the senses.

5) Best Served and Paired: 
For the best experience, we recommend serving Winterdale Shaw at room temperature to fully appreciate its flavors and texture. This cheese is perfect for a ploughman's lunch or to add a unique twist to Welsh Rarebit. Pair it with a crisp white wine or a full-bodied red for a truly indulgent experience.

6) A Cheese You Can Trust: 
Winterdale Shaw is not just a delicious cheese, it is also a cheese you can trust. In 2013, it became the UK's first carbon neutral cheese, produced using sustainable methods such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps. Its quality has also been recognized through numerous awards and accolades, making it a must-try for all cheese lovers.
