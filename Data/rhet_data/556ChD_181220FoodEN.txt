1) Description of Cheese: Rainbow's Gold is a unique, unpasteurised cheese from Somerset, England. It is proudly made by Phil Rainbow of the Somerset Cheese Company, using traditional methods and locally-sourced ingredients.

2) Description of Product: This cheese is based on a cheddar recipe, but what sets it apart is the special 'Golden Chalice' ale from Glastonbury that it is washed in. This gives Rainbow's Gold a softer, stickier texture than a typical cheddar. It has a weight of 250g and is available in a beautifully crumbly and melt-in-your-mouth texture.

3) Description of Process: Rainbow's Gold is carefully prepared using unpasteurised cow's milk and vegetarian rennet. It is then aged to perfection, allowing the unique flavors to develop and mature.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: The cheese has a surprisingly strong flavor with grassy, farmyard notes. It is also known for its lingering, pleasant aftertaste. The aroma is equally delightful, making it a sensory experience for cheese lovers.

5) Serving Suggestions: For the best experience, we recommend serving Rainbow's Gold at room temperature. It can be presented on a cheeseboard, where it will surely be the star of the show. This cheese pairs perfectly with a hoppy beer, such as 'Madness IPA' by the Wild Beer Co, or a strong Belgian style beer like Troubador Obscura or Troubador Magma. It also goes well with a variety of foods, making it a versatile addition to any meal. For a truly indulgent experience, pair it with a full-bodied red wine.
