1) Shropshire Blue - A Delicious British Cheese
Shropshire Blue, made by renowned Stilton makers Cropwell Bishop, is a cheese with a rich history and a unique geographical provenance. Despite its name, this cheese is not made in Shropshire, but rather in the Stilton producing regions of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, and Derbyshire. Originally made in Scotland, this cheese has become a beloved British delicacy.

2) A Cheese with Distinct Characteristics
Shropshire Blue is a visually stunning cheese with its vibrant orange hue, thanks to the addition of natural dye annatto. Its texture is firm, making it perfect for slicing and melting. This cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk and uses vegetarian rennet, making it suitable for vegetarians. Each piece weighs 250g, making it an ideal size for sharing.

3) Crafted with Care - The Preparation and Aging Process
The cheesemaking process of Shropshire Blue is a true pleasure to behold. The evening and morning milk are combined before adding the starter culture, rennet, and penicillium roqueforti, which gives the cheese its distinctive blue veining. After the curds form, they are drained, milled, and salted before being hand-ladled into their molds. The cheese is then aged for a total of 5 weeks, allowing the blue veining to develop and the flavors to mature.

4) Aroma and Flavor That Will Delight Your Senses
Shropshire Blue has a bold and tangy flavor, similar to that of a Stilton, but with a unique twist. The addition of annatto gives this cheese a slightly nutty and sweet flavor, making it stand out from other blue cheeses. Its aroma is equally enticing, with a rich and earthy scent that will awaken your taste buds.

5) Versatile and Delicious - Serving Suggestions
Shropshire Blue is a versatile cheese that can be enjoyed in many ways. For a simple and elegant presentation, serve it on a cheese board at room temperature. For a more indulgent experience, try it in a toasted sandwich with roasted sweet peppers and caramelized walnuts. This cheese also pairs well with honey, macadamia nuts, and a port dressing in a salad. For the perfect accompaniment, enjoy it with a glass of full-bodied red wine.

6) Award-Winning Quality
Shropshire Blue has been recognized for its exceptional quality, winning the "Supreme Champion" award at the 2016 British Cheese Awards. It also received the titles of "Best English Cheese" and "Best Blue Cheese." This cheese is made with the highest standards and has undergone rigorous quality tests to ensure its excellence.
