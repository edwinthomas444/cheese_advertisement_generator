2) Description of Product: This cheese has a striking deep orange color, thanks to the use of natural annatto dye. It has a cheddar-like texture, but with a rich and nutty flavor and a light lemony finish. Each 250g piece is bound in cloth and aged for up to 18 months, giving it a satisfying depth of flavor. It is made with the farm's own unpasteurised cow's milk, with traditional rennet used in the production process.

3) Description of Process: The milk is first combined with annatto before being scalded, cut, salted, and pressed. The cheese is then aged for up to 18 months, allowing it to develop its unique flavor profile. This is a traditional process, with Red Leicester cheese typically only being aged for 6 months.

4) Description of Smell and Taste: Vintage Sparkenhoe Red Leicester has a subtly tangy aroma and a rich, nutty flavor. The light lemony finish adds a refreshing twist to the traditional cheddar-like taste.
