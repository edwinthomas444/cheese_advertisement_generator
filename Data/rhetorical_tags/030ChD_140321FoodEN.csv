British Brie,M1
"Many people are genuinely surprised when they learn that Brie and Camembert are produced in the UK, believing that these cheeses can only be made in France. In fact both are generic names referring to a recipe. By contrast CBrie de Meaux and Camembert de Normandie are both protected names referring to specific recipes which may only be made in their respective regions. In the UK Brie and Camembert are made by a number of smaller producers and in addition by two companies who are of a scale to be able to supply all of the major multiple retailers.",M3
