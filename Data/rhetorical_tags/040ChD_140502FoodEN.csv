Shropshire Blue Shropshire Blue,M1
"Until recently, Shropshire Blue had never been made in Shropshire. It started out as a Scottish attempt to replicate Stilton cheese but with a subtle twist of adding annatto to the milk to give it an orange hue.",M3
"The result is a soft textured, mellow, blue cheese with a glorious contrast of colours between the orange hue of the curd and the delicate blue veins.",M2
"Most of the Shropshire Blue is made in the East Midlands by 4 of the Stilton dairies %u2013 Colston Bassett Dairy, Long Clawson Dairy, Cropwell Bishop Creamery and Tuxford & Tebbutt - but Belton Farm, The Shropshire Cheese Company and Ludlow Food Centre, now make Shropshire Blue to add to their wide cheese selections.",M1
