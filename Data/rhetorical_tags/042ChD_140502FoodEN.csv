"History
Wensleydale cheese has been made in Wensleydale since 1150, when the Cistercian monks first settled in the dale, and established a monastery at Fors, just four miles from Hawes. Some years later the monks moved, because of hostile natives and inclement weather, to Jervaulx in Lower Wensleydale. These French Cistercian monks brought with them their special recipe for the making of cheese, which continued to be produced at Jervaulx until the dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540. The cheese was made originally from sheep%u2019s milk but over time cows%u2019 milk was also used. The art of making fine cheese, which the monks had developed, was passed from the Monks to local farmers' wives who, for more than three hundred years, produced the cheese in their own farmhouses. Often the cheese came out as a blue cheese %u2013 as it matured so cracks in the coat would allow narturally occuring blue mould spores (from leather harnesses often found in the barns where the cheese was stored) into the cheese to create the blue veining.
 
In 1897 Mr Edward Chapman, a corn and provisions merchant of Hawes, began to purchase milk from surrounding farms to use for the manufacture of Wensleydale cheese on a larger scale. The industrial depression of the 1930s made trading conditions difficult leaving the creamery in significant debt to farmers and Mr Chapman's dairy was facing closure.
Farmers, who were owed money by the dairy, were offered contracts by the Milk Marketing Board to take dales milk to a national dairy miles away. The farmers, although they were creditors, were adamant that the Hawes dairy should continue, and they found a champion of their cause in Kit Calvert, one of their number. In 1935 Kit Calvert called a meeting in the Town Hall and gathered enough support to rescue the dairy, the only one producing cheese in the heart of Wensleydale.

Wensleydale production ceased during the second world war %u2013 the only cheese being made was a national Cheddar style cheese produced to a standard recipe to enable efficient distribution and rationing. Production resumed in the early 1950s but at much lower levels than those seen before 1939.

In 1966 the Milk Marketing Board purchased Wensleydale Creamery. By this time Wensleydale cheese was being made in different dairies and farms throughout England and included 3 dairies in the Wensleydale itself. In May 1992 Dairy Crest, a subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, closed the Hawes creamery, the only one then left in the Dale, and transferred production of Wensleydale cheese to a multi purpose cheese plant in Lancashire.

Former managers at Hawes eventually agreed a management buy-out in November 1992 and cheese making resumed.",M3
"Today, Wensleydale is still made in different parts of the UK by a number of small and medium sized cheesemakers,  who specialise in the making of English regional cheeses, as well as in the Dale itself.

The Hawes Creamery has applied for a European Union %u201CProtected Designation of Origin%u201D for %u201CYorkshire Wensleydale Cheese%u201D to differentiate its Wensleydale made in the Dale from that produced elsewhere in the UK.

"Other Producers of Wensleydale
Wenslydale Cheese is also produced in other parts of the UK for, like many British cheeses, the name describes a recipe or a method  of production and is regarded as a generic name for a particular style of cheese. Most of the Wensleydale made in other parts of the UK %u2013 mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire %u2013 is made on farms and small creameries and still relies on traditional cheesemaking methods using open vats.",M1
Some is made in traditional wheels but the bulk is made in blocks which then makes the cheese easier to pre-pack.,M3
