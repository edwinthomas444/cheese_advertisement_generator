"Who'd have thought it, a creamy Lancashire from Dewlay turned blue. Once tried, never forgotten . Garstang Blue is a unique, rich, mellow and indulgent blue cheese with an open body and a velvety, smooth and creamy texture. Creamy white in colour with blue veins radiating from the rind.",M2
"It is best served at room temperature.

"Garstang Blue is ideal for those who find most blue cheese a little too strong, as it has a softer and milder tone with a smooth and creamy texture.",M2
"It is superb for crumbling into salads, pastas and soups. It also works well with sauces and dressings with a honey, white wine, cream or butter base.",M5
"As an accompaniment try a good Merlot or Pinot Noir.
