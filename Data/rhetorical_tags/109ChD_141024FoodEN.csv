"We have added the colour to clearly differentiate it from our Lincolnshire Poacher. The colour comes from the addition of annatto to the milk in the vat at the start of cheese making. Annatto is a natural colour widely used in the cheese world and comes from the seed of the Anchiote tree in South America.

Unlike Lincolnshire Poacher, it is made using vegetarian rennet.",M2
