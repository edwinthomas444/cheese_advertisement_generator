It can also be used in cooking, adding depth and richness to dishes such as mac and cheese or grilled cheese sandwiches.\n6) Quality Assurance: Paxtons Cave Aged Cheddar has earned the coveted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certification, ensuring its geographical, milk source, and recipe specifications.
