After the addition of starter culture and rennet to the milk, the curds are cut and scalded at a temperature of (NUMBER) Â°C with the whey for (NUMBER) minutes.

Produced via (PROCESS) of the milk rather than by (PROCESS). 
After the curds are formed they are scalded, which means that the cheese will not melt when heated.
Once the curds are produced, the whey is drained off.
The soft curds from their (ANIMAL) milk are ladled by hand into individual moulds and gently drained. 
Curds are formed and left to drain overnight. The whey is removed and the curd cut into (SHAPE) and stacked and turned every (NUMBER) minutes. The curd is milled and salted, put into (SHAPE) moulds and lightly pressed. After (NUMBER) days the mould is removed and the surfaces rubbed to form the crust and at (NUMBER) weeks skewered to allow air to enter the body of the cheese and so form the blue veins.
The cheese is then sealed with cloth or other wrapping material and at about (NUMBER) weeks of age the cheese is pierced with stainless steel needles to allow air to enter the body of the cheeses. This activates the blue mould which then proceeds to break down the protein in the cheese and create the blue veins.
It has (PLANT) leaves wrapped around it after it has come out of the cheese press, and finally it is given a light spraying of penicillium candidum white mould to help give the cheese its unique appearance and flavour.
This traditional method is unique to (CHEESE NAME) and is still adhered to by (NAME OF THE CHEESERY) today.
