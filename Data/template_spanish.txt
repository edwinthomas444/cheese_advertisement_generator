Handmade using a unique recipe developed over many years along with carefully selected starter cultures.
It is based on an old fashioned traditional (NOMBRE DEL QUESO) recipe with a modern twist.
(NOMBRE DEL QUESO) is traditionally hand-made.
The cheese is still made in the traditional shape using the traditional method and skills. After the addition of starter culture and rennet to the milk, the curds are cut and scalded at a temperature of (NÚMERO) °C with the whey for (NÚMERO) minutes. The whey is then drained away leaving the curd which is milled and salted. The cheese is then moulded and mechanically pressed for up to (NÚMERO) days and is ready for consumption at around (NÚMERO) months.
(NOMBRE DEL QUESO) is brine dipped.
(NOMBRE DEL QUESO) takes (NÚMERO) hours to make.
The cheese is then shaped into (FORMA) and pressed.
(NOMBRE DEL QUESO) is naturally smoked, using (TIPO DE MADERA).
It is gently smoked, over (TIPO DE MADERA) for (NÚMERO) days.
(NOMBRE DEL QUESO) is left open to the air to mature which results in a (CUALIDAD) rind with a (COLOR) mould.
It can only be produced in a (FORMA) shape and is never pressed.
Some is made in traditional (FORMA), but the bulk is made in (FORMA), which then makes the cheese easier to pre-pack.
It is made to a traditional recipe with (ORIGEN) rennet and is crucially hand-ladled. 
Produced via (PROCESO) of the milk rather than by (PROCESO). 
After the curds are formed they are scalded, which means that the cheese will not melt when heated.
Once the curds are produced, the whey is drained off.
The soft curds from their (ANIMAL) milk are ladled by hand into individual moulds and gently drained. 
Curds are formed and left to drain overnight. The whey is removed and the curd cut into (FORMA) and stacked and turned every (NÚMERO) minutes. The curd is milled and salted, put into (FORMA) moulds and lightly pressed. After (NÚMERO) days the mould is removed and the surfaces rubbed to form the crust and at (NÚMERO) weeks skewered to allow air to enter the body of the cheese and so form the blue veins.
The cheese is then sealed with cloth or other wrapping material and at about (NÚMERO) weeks of age the cheese is pierced with stainless steel needles to allow air to enter the body of the cheeses. This activates the blue mould which then proceeds to break down the protein in the cheese and create the blue veins.
It has (PLANTA) leaves wrapped around it after it has come out of the cheese press, and finally it is given a light spraying of penicillium candidum white mould to help give the cheese its unique appearance and flavour.
This traditional method is unique to (NOMBRE DEL QUESO) and is still adhered to by (NOMBRE DE LA QUESERÍA) today.
