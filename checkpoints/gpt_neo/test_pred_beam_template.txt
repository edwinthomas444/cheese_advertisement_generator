The cheese is then aged for a minimum of three months, allowing it to develop its unique flavor and texture. During this time, the cheese is carefully monitored and turned regularly to ensure even aging and the perfect taste. The cheese is then packaged and ready to be enjoyed by cheese connoisseurs.
