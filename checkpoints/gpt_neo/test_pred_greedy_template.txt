The cheese-making process of Cheddar is a labor of love, with each wheel being carefully handcrafted by hand using traditional methods. The milk is first pasteurized and then cultured with a unique blend of starter and salt, which gives the cheese its distinctive pungent aroma and flavor. The cheese is then aged for a minimum of three months, allowing it to develop its crusty and nutty texture, and complex and fruity flavor. After around 12 weeks, the cheese is typically sold in cylindrical shapes, known as "cheese wheels" at The Dairy Farm. This aging process also gives it a distinct aroma and taste, making it a must-try for cheese lovers.
