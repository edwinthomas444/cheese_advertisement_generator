The cheese-making process for Dovedale involves covering it in nettles to slow the natural process of ripening. This allows the flavours to develop more fully and the texture to become softer and creamier. The cheese is then aged for around eight weeks, allowing it to develop its distinct blue flavour and texture. This is a traditional process, similar to that of Roquefort, but with a unique twist - the nettle is dipped in plain calcium lactate to give it a more intense blue taste. The rennet is not used in the production of Dovedales, as the cheese is aged to a lower acidity than Roqueboard. This results in a lower saltiness and a better balance of flavours. The result is a cheese that is full of character and depth, with a distinct blue taste that cannot be replicated by mass-produced cheeses.
