The cheese-making process for Cheddar involves careful preparation and aging. The curds are made by hand and then transferred to a cheese vat, where they are aged for a specific amount of time to achieve the perfect flavor and texture. The cheese-makers follow a "cheese-script" to ensure the correct amount of salt, micro-flora, and starter culture in the milk, and the correct environment and temperature in the vat. This process results in a Cheddar that is truly one of a kind.
