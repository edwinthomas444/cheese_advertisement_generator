Every piece of Beenleigh Blue is prepared and aged with care, ensuring the highest quality and flavor. The cheese is made using traditional methods, ensuring that every bite is a true delight. It is then aged for a minimum of 3 months, allowing the flavors to develop and mature, resulting in a truly unique cheese. As the cheese matures, it becomes harder and darker in color, with a distinct crumbly texture. This process results in a cheese that is both full of flavor and character. As it ages, the cheese becomes drier and creamier, making it a perfect choice for cheese lovers who enjoy a rich and creamy texture.
